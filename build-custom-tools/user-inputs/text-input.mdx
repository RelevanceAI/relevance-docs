## What is a Text input
Text input is an input component that allows you to enter a line of text. 
The value can be entered by the user or later fetched from an uploaded dataset (bulk-run).

## When to use the Text input component
The Text input component is suitable for short pieces of text. Such as a question, name, topic, etc.

## How to add a Text input to my custom Tool
The Text input component is listed under User inputs. You can add it to your Tool using the main section
or the side-bar.
