## What is a Numeric input
Numeric input is an input component that allows you to enter a numeric value to be treated as a number (i.e. not a string).
The value can be entered by the user or later fetched from an uploaded dataset (bulk-run).

## When to use the Numeric input component
The Numeric input component is suitable for situations when a number is needed for an analysis that involves some math or counting. 
For instance, when a process needs to be executed x number of times.

## How to add a Numeric input to my custom Tool
The Numeric input component is listed under User inputs. You can add it to your Tool using the main section
or the side-bar.

## Numeric input setting
<Snippet file="components/inputs/general-input-setting.mdx" />
<Snippet file="components/inputs/default-value-tip.mdx" />

Keep in mind that the entered value must be a number and when used in a code step it must be treated as a number.

## Access the entered number
To access the entered text use the variable mode `{{}}` and the input step name. Under the default setting it is accessible
via `{{number}}` (or `params.number` in  a JavaScript step).
