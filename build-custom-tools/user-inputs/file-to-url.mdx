## What is a File to URL input
File to URL input is an input component that allows you to upload a file to the cloud and access it
via a temporarily URL. This URL can be used in other steps such as Audio transcription, or PDF-to-Text
to access the content of the file.

<Tip>
Relevance does not store your file permanently for security reasons. This means the provided URL is
temporary and expires within 3 days after upload. Therefore, it is recommended to apply the desired analysis
steps right after upload.

## When to use the File to URL component
The File to URL input component is suitable for when you need to provide a file as an input to another component.
For instance to an OCR step.
