## What is a File to text input
File to text input is an input component that allows you to upload a file. It then 
automatically extracts all the included text or transcribe the file. This text can
later be used as the source of truth is tasks like question-answering or summarization.

## When to use the File to text component
The File to text input component is suitable for when you need to upload a file
to work with the content. For instance, to provide the content of a 10 page report to a 
Large Language Model (LLM) to summarize the information to 2 pages. 
Or when you want an LLM list all the items discussed in an audio recording.

Supported formats are 
* PDF (no ocr)
* Word (.doc, .docx)
* Excel (.xlsx, .xls)
* CSV
* Audio (.mp3, .mp4, .mp2, aac, .wav, .flac, .pcm, .m4a, .ogg, .opus, .webm)
* JSON
* TXT

Note: Audio transcription is done using the Deepgram model.

## How to add a File to text input to my custom Tool
