Although Relevance in general is a zero or low code platform, the functionality of adding Javascript code snippets to your Tools is 
available and fully supported.
Code snippets can be useful in tasks such as pre or post processing of data or analysis at which LLMs are not good.

## How to use a Javascript step

### Add the component
To use Javascript, you need to add a "Code-Javascript" step to your Tool (check how to get started with 
[creating a tool](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/getting_started)).

Enter your code in the code section as you do in any other IDE (e.g. VS code, WebStorm)

### Access to input variables and other steps' output

* **Access to input variables** is via `params`. `params` is a dictionary and names of variables are the dictionary keys. For example, 
if there is an input parameter named "title" you can access to title value using `params.title`

* **Access to other steps' output** is via `steps`. `steps` is a dictionary and names of steps are the dictionary keys. For example, 
if there is a step named "summary" you can access its produced value using `steps.summary.output`.

Note that you can set the output of this step to be a string generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) such as GPT. This can be done
by clicking on the LLM icon on the top right.
