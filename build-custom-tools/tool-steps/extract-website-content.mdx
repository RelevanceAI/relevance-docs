There is a large amount of text data available on the net which can be an amazing source for tasks such as Q/A, research,
and context generation. Relevance provides you with an easy-to-use component for scraping website contents

## How to use the Extract website content step

### Add the component
You need to add the "Extract website content" step to your Tool (check how to get started with 
[creating a tool](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/getting_started)).

### Website URL

Directly enter a URL in the box or use the `{{` to activate the variable mode. For instance, if the URL is in an input
component called `my_url`, use `{{my_url}}`. Or if the URL is the output of a Google-Search step, use `{{google.organic[0].link}}`
to access the url in the first search results ([FAQ](/build-custom-tools/faq#error-url-issue)).

### Method
You can specify if you wish to scrape data as Text or HTML. By default, Relevance scraps the Text.

### Element Selector
You can specify which element from the HTML components to scrape. By default, it is set to `body`.
Note that using `+ Add new`, you can specify a list of elements to be scrapped.

### Extra headers
If you need to provide special information to be able to scrape a website, provide the data as a JSON object.
The below object shows an example where an authentication token called `auth-token` and a `user-id` are required.

```
{
    "auth-token":"AUTHENTICATION-TOKEN",
    "user-id":"USER-ID"
}
```
