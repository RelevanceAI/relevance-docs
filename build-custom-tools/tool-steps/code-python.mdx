Although Relevance in general is a zero or low code platform, the functionality of adding Python code snippets to your Tools is 
available and fully supported.
Code snippets can be useful in tasks such as pre or post processing of data or analysis at which LLMs are not good.

## How to use a Python step

### Add the component
To use Python, you need to add a "Code-Python" step to your Tool (check how to get started with 
[creating a tool](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/getting_started)).

### Python packages and runtime commands

![Python step](/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/python-code-fields.png)

You can specify all the required Python packages (e.g. pandas) under `Packages` and all the 
Runtime commands (apt-get install cuda) under `Runtime Commands`.

Enter your code in the code section as you do in any other IDE (e.g. VS code, PyCharm)


### Access to input variables and other steps' output
* **Access to input variables** is via `params`. `params` is a dictionary and the names of variables are the dictionary keys. For example, 
if there is an input parameter named "title" you can access to title value using `params["title"]`.

* **Access to other steps' output** is via `steps`. `steps` is a dictionary and the names of steps are the dictionary keys. For example, 
if there is a step named "summary" you can access its produced value using `steps["summary"]["output"]`.

## Common errors
The most common errors seen in our logs are Python coding related errors to which there are millions of resources available online.
However, occasionally, users encounter the `Code execution timed out` error. Keep in mind that Python snippet execution time
cannot exceed 4 hours.
