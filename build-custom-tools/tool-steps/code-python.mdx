Although Relevance in general is a zero or low code platform, the functionality of adding Python code snippets to your Tools is 
available and fully supported.
Code snippets can be useful is tasks such as pre or post processing of data or analysis at which LLMs are not good.

## How to use a Python step

### Add the component
To use Python a code you need to add a "Code-Python" step to your Tool.

### Python packages and runtime commands

You can specify all the required Python packages (e.g. pandas) under `Packages` and all the 
Runtime commands (apt-get install cuda) under `Runtime Commands`.

Enter your code in the code section as you do in any other IDE (e.g. VS code, PyCharm)


### Access to input variables and other steps' output
* **Access to input variables** is via `params`. `params` is a dictionary and names of variables are the dictionary keys. For example, 
if there is an input parameter named "title" you can access to title value using `params["title"]

* **Access to other steps' output** is via `steps`. `steps` is a dictionary and names of steps are the dictionary keys. For example, 
if there is a step named "summary" you can access to its produced value using `steps["summary"]
