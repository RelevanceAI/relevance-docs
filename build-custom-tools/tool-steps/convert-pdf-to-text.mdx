PDF-to-Text allows you to extract all the text data from PDF files and further analyze the text or use the text in applications
such as question answering.
Note that you can save the extracted text into a knowledge-set to avoid redoing the PDF-to-Text step.

On this page, we will introduce three available Tool steps at Relevance to convert audio/video to text.
## How to use Convert PDF to text step

### Add the component
Add the PDF to text converter step to your Tool (check how to get started with 
[creating a tool](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/getting_started)).

### File URL
A PDF-to-text converter requires a file as an input. If your file is publicly accessible on the web (i.e. with no 
authentication or sign-up requirement), simply provide the URL directly or as a 
[text input](/build-custom-tools/user-inputs/text-input). Otherwise, you will need to add a 
[File-to-URL](/build-custom-tools/user-inputs/file-to-url) input.
In either situation, use the `{{variable name}}` to provide the data to the converter.

### Use OCR
OCR (Optical character recognition or optical character reader) is needed for image PDFs (e.g. scanned data).
This option uses more credits. So, only activate it for image PDFs.

### Available converters
* Fast converter: Relevance AI's default audio and video-to-text converter which is fast and reasonably accurate
* Quality converter: Slower and more accurate compared to the previous option

## Access the output
The output is a dictionary with two keys `text` and `number_of_pages` containing the extracted text and the number 
of pages in the file respectively.

```
pdf_to_text.text
pdf_to_text.number_of_pages
```


## Common errors
