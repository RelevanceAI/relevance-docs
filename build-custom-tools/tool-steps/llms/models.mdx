We provide support for not just GPT, but other vendors such as Cohere and Anthropic. We are always adding to this list. Implement once, with the knowledge that as new models come out, your product can take advantage!

You can specify the model like so:

    ```ts
    const { answer } = step('prompt_completion', {
