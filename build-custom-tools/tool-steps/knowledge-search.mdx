A vectorized dataset can be used in a vector similarity search. 
Simply copy the vector name and paste it into the vector field in the 'Knowledge search' step of your Tool.

Go to the chain where you want to use the vectorized dataset and add a Knowledge searchâ€™ step for vector similarity search. 
Select the dataset you've created and set the 'search query'. This will be the user input you want to match with the most similar examples in your dataset.

Then choose the model. It should correspond with the one we used to vectorize the data.
