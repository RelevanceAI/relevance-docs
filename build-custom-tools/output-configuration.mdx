This guide will assist you in sharing and deploying your AI app by configuring the LLM output for a clearer, more understandable result.

So far, we have walked through creating an AI app, adding inputs, knowledge and analysis steps. 
We want to ensure, Tools are user-friendly and the output(s) are configured correctly. 
So, the next step is to configure the output, add description to make them fully ready to be shared the Tool team and colleagues. 



## Add a description
On your Tool, use the "Build" tab and add a description on top. This simple step can make your Tool UI look more professional and easier to understand.

<Tip>
Tool description is proven to be important in [Agents](/agent/agent) performance.

## LLM output
The [LLM component](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/llms/llm) provides you with various outputs. You can set what to include on the Tool to avoid confusing users.
On the "Build" page, scroll to your LLM component and click on `Output` on the top right of the component.

## Tool output
On the "Build" page, scroll to the bottom of the page to find the Tool output with the configure button. 
By default, it will infer the last step of the Tool and use its output.

### Name your output
If you wish to customize the output, disable "Infer output from last step of chain".
Using `{{}}` select the desired output variable. For example the answer from a LLM step. 
Note that when you type in `{{`, the platform provides you with all the available components. 
Simply click on the desired one, for instance `{{llm.answer}}`.

You can also name the output filed to make it much more user-friendly. In the picture above, we have named the output ‘answer’.

### Choose multiple outputs
Click on `Add new output key` to add more variables to your Tool. Using the `X` on the bottom right of each entry, you can remove them.

### Save and share your Tool
Once you've configured the everything, hit save on the top right. You are ready to [share](/templates/introduction#share-a-tool) your Tool with your team and colleagues.
