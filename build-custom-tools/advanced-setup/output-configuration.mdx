This guide will assist you in sharing and deploying your AI Tool by configuring the Tool output for a clearer, more understandable result.

After Tools are created, we want to ensure, they are user-friendly and the output(s) are configured correctly. 

## Add a description
On your Tool, use the "Build" tab and add a description on top. This simple step can make your Tool UI look more professional and easier to understand.

<Tip>
Tool description is proven to be important in [Agents](/agent/agent) performance.

## LLM step output
The [LLM component](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/llms/llm) provides you with various outputs. You can set what to include on the Tool to avoid confusing users.
On the "Build" page, scroll to your LLM component and click on `Output` on the top right of the component.

Note that you can rename each output by clicking on the name (written after `output.`). You can remove the output by clicking on `x` on the bottom right.

## Tool output
On the "Build" page, scroll to the bottom of the page to find "Tool output" box with a "Configure output" button in the center. 
By default, Tools return the output of the last step. You can change the output name and modify the setup.

### Name your output
If you wish to customize the output, first click on `Configure output` and disable "Infer output from last step of tool".
Using `{{}}` select the desired output variable. For example the answer from a LLM step. 
Note that when you type in `{{`, the platform provides you with all the available items. 
Simply click on the desired one, for instance `{{llm.answer}}`. If there is an LLM component in your tool called `llm` whose output is saved in a variable
called `answer`.

Keep in mind that similar to all other outputs, it is possible to also name the final output filed to make it much more user-friendly. 
In the picture above, we have named the output ‘answer’ (marked with number 4).

### Choose multiple outputs
On the "Set up the output for this tool" page, click on `Add new output key` to add more output variables to your Tool. 
Using the `X` on the bottom right of each entry, you can remove them.

### Save and share your Tool
Once you've configured the everything, hit save on the top right. You are ready to [share](/templates/introduction#share-a-tool) your Tool with your 
team and colleagues.
