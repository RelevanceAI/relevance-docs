### How do I set default values for input parameters?
Click on the setting icon, located on the bottom right of the input component. Set the values, and click on "Set current value".

### How do I insert variables into CODE step?
Access to variables is possible via the `params` parameter. For instance, to access a variable called `name`,
use `params.name` is Javascript or `params["name"]` in Python.

### How do I insert variables into the API step?
On your [API](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/api) component, change the body to edit as string and use `{{}}` to access variables.

### How to make running a step conditional?
Click on the three vertical dot on the top right of the step and select "Add conditions".
See the full guide at [Adding condition](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/getting_started#run-a-step-if-a-condition-is-met) to a step.

### Why do I have to use single or double quotations around variables in my prompts?
Such marks (e.g. single, double, triple quote marks) are not required nor have a direct functional utility. 
It is a prompting technique that has been found to work well with LLMs.
Keep in mind that an LLM prompt is a long piece of text composed of instructions, examples, etc.
single or double or triple quote marks around a varible X are just to specify the scope of X (i.e. the beginning and end of the string X within the prompt).
A side note that the whole {{X}} brings the variable X into the prompt, meaning there won't be {{}} around it when passed to the LLM.

### How do I use the [Checkbox input](/build-custom-tools/user-inputs/check-box) component as a condition for running a step?
[Add a condition](/build-custom-tools/advanced-setup/conditions) to your step. 
And use the `{{checkbox variable name}}` as the value for the condition. For example, under the default step name:

* `{{checkbox}}` when checkbox is ticked
* `{{!checkbox}}` when checkbox is not ticked

  <p align="center">
  <img width="450" height="250" align="center" src="/images/build-custom-tools/checkbox-condition.png" />
  </p>
  
### How to run a step multiple time like a loop?
Click on the three vertical dot on the top right of the step and select "Enable foreach".
See the full guide at [Loop through a step](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/getting_started#run-a-step-multiple-times-in-a-loop).

### How to reduce hallucination for LLM?
Here are a list of steps to take to improve your experience with LLMs:
* Providing good and precise [system prompt](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/llms/llm-advance-setting#system-prompt)
* providing good prompt [Tips on a good prompt](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/llms/prompt#tips-on-writing-a-good-prompt-prompt-engineering)
* Providing data as a background [knowledge](/build-custom-tools/knowledge/knowledge)
* More experiment with LLMs

### Why is the LLM output cut off in the middle of a sentence and how to fix it?
LLMs have the capacity for a limited number of tokens. At Relevance, we use ~90% for the prompt (including knowledge) and the rest for the output.
This means, if your prompt/knowledge are very rich in the number of tokens, there will be not enough room for the full output.

In almost all such cases, the most relevant pieces of knowledge are fetched from the knowledge 
[How to handle large text](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/llms/how-to-handle-too-much-text).
Most relevant is a vector search applied to your knowledge to only select the best matching entries within the context to be fed to LLM. 
By default the top 100 matching entries are fetched. Decrease the page size parameter under advanced option in 
[most relevant](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/llms/how-to-handle-too-much-text#most-relevant-data).

### How do I set multiple outputs?
In the last step of your Tool, click on `Configure output` button. Disable "Infer output from the last step".
* Using the `Add new output key` you can add outputs
* Using `{{}}` you can access to variables and steps' outputs

More details are provided at [Output configuration](/build-custom-tools/advanced-setup/output-configuration)

### Error: Wrong chat history setup
Below errors can occur when "Conversation history" is not set correctly.

![LLM - conversation History](/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/llm-conversation-history.png)

```
Studio transformation prompt_completion input validation error: must be array {"type":"array"} /history
```
Provide values for the conversation or use the `x` to remove it

```
Studio transformation prompt_completion input validation error: must be equal to one of the allowed values {"allowedValues":["user","ai","function"]} /history/0/role
```
Note that the only allowed roles are `ai` and `user`.

### Error: Rate limit
```
429:
      {"message":"Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
      in organization org-JfRBhZhDGaEQPgWeVxj3OEGF on tokens per min. Limit: 180000
      / min. Current: 1 / min. Contact us through our help center at
      help.openai.com if you continue to have
      issues.","type":"tokens","param":null,"code":"rate_limit_exceeded"}
```

This error happens when the used API key is set to a different rate limit compared to what Relevance uses by default. 
Trying again with different intervals of pause helps with this issue.

### Error: URL issue
This error occurs when the input to "Extract website content" receives an input parameter that is not of type string (e.g. a URL).

```
Studio transformation browserless_scrape input validation error: must be string {"type":"string"} /website_url
```
 
![Extract website content](/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/extract-website-content.png)

A common situation where this happens is when the output of another step (e.g. Google search as shown below) is used as the input to "Extract website content".
If the output is a list or an object similar to the example below, you need to access the URL field.

![Google search](/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/google-search-output.png)

In our example, we can access the string URLs in three ways:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Access one URL in the results">
    If the above result is the output of a `google search` step, accessing the first link is via `google.organic[0].link`
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="For Loop">
    If you wish to check all the items in the returned results, enable `foreach` options
    ![Enable foreach](/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/for-each-access.png)
    And specify the source list and the name of the field you wish to access in each item of the list.
    ![list access](/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/extract-website-content-for-each.png)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="LLM to extract URL">
    The output of Google search can be used as the input to a LLM instructed to extract and return only the first URL.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Error: Validators

At Relevance, you can [set up validators](build-custom-tools/tool-steps/llms/validators) for your LLM component to ensure that the output 
follows the desired format. The below error happens when the LLM's output does not meet the criteria. Prompt engineering is the best way to 
handle such as situation. Try rewording your prompt and providing examples. 

```
Prompt completion did not pass validation
```

### Error: Credits
The following error indicates that the credits are below zero and you need to top up to be able to continue using the platform.

```
Organization Entitlement setting negative_credits : {"limit":-10000} does not allow this action.
```
