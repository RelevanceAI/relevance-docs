### How do I insert variables into CODE step?
Access to variables is possible via the `params` parameter. For instance, to access a variable called `name`,
use `params.name` is Javascript or `params["name"]` in Python.

### How do I insert variables into the API step?
On your [API](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/api) component, change the body to edit as string and use `{{}}` to access variables..

### Why do I have to use `"""` or "`" around variables in my prompts?
Such marks (e.g. triple quote marks) are not required nor have a direct functional utility. It is a prompting technique that has been found to work well with LLMs.
Keep in mind that an LLM prompt is a long piece of text composed of instructions, examples, etc.
"""X""" / "X" / X are just to specify the scope of X (i.e. the beginning and end of the string X within the prompt).
A side note that the whole {{X}} brings the variable X into the prompt, meaning there won't be {{}} around it.

### How to make running a step conditional?
Click on the three vertical dot on the top right of the step and select "Add conditions".
See the full guide at [Adding condition](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/getting_started#run-a-step-if-a-condition-is-met) to a step.
