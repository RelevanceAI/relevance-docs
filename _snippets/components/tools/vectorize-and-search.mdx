[Vectorize and search](/tool/tool-steps/vectorize-and-search): 

Vectors are representation of data in vector space. In other words,
vectors are numeric representationds in which items that are semantically
close to each other are located close to one another as well.
This is a how AI and many machine learning algorithms work accurately.
The Vectorize and search component takes the source content (e.g. content
of a PDF file) and a query, vectorizes the data and query and returns the
most relevance piece in the data source as the answer  to the query.
