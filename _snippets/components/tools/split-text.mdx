[Split text](/custom-tools/tool-steps/split-text) breaks large text content
such as a PDF file or content of a scraped website to smaller chunks of text.
When working with large amount of text for tasks such as question-answering,
it is unlikely that the whole content all-together is the answer to a given question.
Therefore, it is highly recommended to break the content into smaller chunks (i.e. 
text splitting).
