Conditions must follow JavaScript rules and be written in `{{}}`. For instance,
* `{{text==="XYZ"}}` --> the variable called `text` is equal to `XYZ`
* `{{text!=="XYZ"}}` --> the variable called `text` is not equal to `XYZ`
* `{{clean.transformed===""}}` --> the output of a code step called `clean` is an empty string
