Imagine there is a list of movie names and you wish to run a large language model on each item to generate a summary.
After enabling Foreach, under `Run this transformation multiple times`, provide the list of items on which the loop should work. 

Next, use `{{foreach.item}}` to access each of the elements in your input list.
