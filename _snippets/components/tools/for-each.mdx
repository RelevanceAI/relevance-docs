If you wish to run a step multiple times, click on the three dot menu located on the top right and select **Enable foreach** from the menu.

Imagine there is a Python step returning a list of items and you wish to run a large language model 
for each of the elements in the list.
After enabling Foreach, under `Run this transformation multiple times`, provide the list of items on which the loop should work. 
In our example, access to the Python step output is via `{{python.transformed}}`.
Next, use `{{foreach.item}}` to access each of the elements.
When running the step, you will have as many output tabs as the number of elements in your list.
