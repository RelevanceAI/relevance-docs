### Delete a step

Click on the three dot menu located on the top right and select **Delete** from the menu.
<p align="center">
<img width="350" height="150" align="center" src="/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/add-delete-condition-loop.png" />
</p>

This will remove the step completely from your Tool. 

<Tip>
If you have used the output of a deleted step in any other steps as a variable, don't forget to remove the variable referral 
or it will cause a runtime error.
