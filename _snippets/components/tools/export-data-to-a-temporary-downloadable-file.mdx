[Export to a temporary file](/custom-tools/tool-steps/export-data-to-a-temporary-downloadable-file)
In many analysis, when the output is generated, it needs to be turned into a downloadable file.
At Relevance this can be easily done via a ready-to-use component.
This component takes some data that is possible to turn into a CSV format, exports the data to 
a downloadable CSV and returns a URL to access the file.
