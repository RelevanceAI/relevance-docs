## Configure output



### Final output
At the end of configuring an enrichment, click on "configure output" and turn off "infer from last step". 
This allows you to set a custom output. Each output item becomes a column in your spreadsheet, so it's crucial to define this to 
prevent unwanted information during a bulk run. 
For instance, in a sentiment analysis Tool, if we want to add an output named "sentiment" and get the values from our LLM step
we would type `{{llm.answer}}`.
