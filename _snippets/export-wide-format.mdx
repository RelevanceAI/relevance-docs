### Export wide format

*  **What is wide/flatten format**

    Wide format or flatten format is to turn categorical fields into numeric.
    An example is shown in the table below where the Categories column contains 3 unique categorical values 
    (`App crashes, Upgrade, Expensive`).

    <Tip>
    Side note: [Text categorization](/templates/text-categorizer-classifier) will produce such results as
    shown in the first table below.
    </Tip>


    |                              **Text response**                     |          **Categories**          |
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
    |Apart from being too costly, the app keeps exiting after the update | App crashes, Upgrade, Expensive  |
    |It crashes after 10 seconds                                         | App crashes                      |
    |Love the latest update                                              | Upgrade                          |

    Below, we can see the wide format export for the table above. There are as many new columns as the existing
    unique categories, with zero/one values indicating if a category applies to the text response in
    the corresponding row.

    |                             **Text response**                      |**App crashes**|**Upgrade**|**Expensive**|
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
    |Apart from being too costly, the app keeps exiting after the update |      1        |     1     |      1      |
    |It crashes after 10 seconds                                         |      1        |     0     |      0      |
    |Love the latest update                                              |      0        |     1     |      0      |

* **Access to wide format export**

    Select the dataset from [data table](/get-started/key-concepts/knowledge) and click on the `Download as CSV` button.

    ![export](/images/general/export.png)

    Export type is set to "Standard" by default, change it to "Wide format".
    Enter the Categorical field name that you wish to flatten (e.g. `Categories` in the table above).

    <Warning>
    The categorical field name should be typed in EXACTLY as is in the data table.
