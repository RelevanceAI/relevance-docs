### How to Access the Variables Tab

After cloning your assistant, you need to add your credentials:

1. **Automatic popup:** A setup popup should appear after cloning → Fill in the values
2. **Manual access:** If the popup doesn't appear:
   - Open your cloned assistant
   - Click the **Variables** tab at the top navigation
   - Fill in all required fields
   - Click **Save**

<Warning>
**Important:** Don't skip this step! Without proper configuration, you'll see authentication errors when trying to use your assistant.
</Warning>
