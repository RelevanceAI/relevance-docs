Note: the `setup` function only allows you to declare each step of a chain. No Javascript you write outside of these steps, except for your returned output will be executed.

However, you can use the `code` function provided in `setup` to run custom Javascript. You can also use the `runIf` function to conditionally run steps, as well as `forEach` to iterate over arrays.
