<Tip>
**Apply audio Tools to multiple files at the same time (bulk-run)**:

1. [Upload](/knowledge) your audio files together in a [data table](/knowledge)
2. [Add an enrichment/bulk-run](/tool/bulk-run) using the desired audio Tool (**Do this step right after uploading your files and activate the bulk run. The URL in the table to access the original file are temporary **)
3. Select the `file_url` field from the table to access the audio file for the bulk-run (Note that the URLs expires in maximum 72 hours from upload)
4. When source file name is required use source_file_name field from the table
