Currently, the easiest way to access a conversation Id is from the page URL.
Click on the target conversation. In the URL, the last piece after the Agent id and before `?studioId=` shows the Conversation Id.
The URL is structured as

`https://app.relevanceai.com/agents/REGION/Project-Id/Agent_Id/Conversation_Id?studioId=agent_....`
