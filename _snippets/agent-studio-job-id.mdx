Run the Python code below with corresponding values for `Region`, `Authorization token` 
and `Agent Id` on your project.

```Python
import requests
import json
import time

# Define the URL, authorization header, and the JSON payload
region = "Region"
url = f"https://api-{region}.stack.tryrelevance.com/latest/agents/trigger"
authorization_token = "Authorization token"
headers = {
    "Authorization": authorization_token,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {"message":{"role":"user","content":"Hello"},"agent_id":"Agent Id"}

# Convert the payload to a JSON string
payload_json = json.dumps(payload)

# Send the POST request
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=payload_json)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Request was successful!")
    print("Response:", response.text)
else:
    print("Request failed with status code:", response.status_code)
    print("Response:", response.text)

```

In a successful run, the output is a dictionary containing "studio_id" and "job_id" which are required for the next step 
(i.e `agent_details`).
We can access the corresponding values via the code below.

```Python
agent_details = response.json()
```
