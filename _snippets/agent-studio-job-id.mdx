* **Step 1: Authorization Token**

    Either directly copy the `Authorization token` from the API page (see above for instructions) or use the 
    `Project id` and `API key` combination as shown in the snippet below:

    ```Python
    authorization_token = f"{project_id}:{api_key}"   # Both values can be found in the API Keys page

    ```

* **Step 2: Region and Agent id**

    Fetch the values as instructed further up in this page
    ```Python
    region = Region       # Can be found in the API Keys page
    agent_id = Agent_id   # Can be found in the Agent page URL

    ```

* **Step3: Agent's studio and job ids**

    Run the Python snippets below with corresponding values for `Region`, `Authorization token` and `Agent Id` on your project.

    ```Python
    import requests
    import json
    import time

    # Define the URL, authorization header, and the JSON payload
    
    url = f"https://api-{region}.stack.tryrelevance.com/latest/agents/trigger"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": authorization_token,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {"message":{"role":"user","content":"Hello"},"agent_id":agent_id}

    # Convert the payload to a JSON string
    payload_json = json.dumps(payload)

    # Send the POST request
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=payload_json)

    # Check the response
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Request was successful!")
        print("Response:", response.text)
    else:
        print("Request failed with status code:", response.status_code)
        print("Response:", response.text)

    ```

    <Tip>
    **The endpoint to access an Agent's info**:

    `https://api-{region}.stack.tryrelevance.com/latest/agents/trigger`

    \<region\> can be found at [API keys](/get-started/key-concepts/api-keys).
    </Tip>

    In a successful run, the output is a dictionary containing "studio_id" and "job_id" which are required for the next step 
    (i.e `agent_details`).
    We can access the corresponding values via the code below.

    ```Python
    agent_details = response.json()
    ```
