On the [Data](/get-started/key-concepts/data) page, you can [create](/data/introduction) new datasets. 
Select your target dataset and once the data table is opened, you can "Enrich" your data using any of the analysis Tools / Templates.

"Enrich" will add a new column to your dataset including the analysis results per rows.

1. Select the desired Tool/Templates
2. Fill in the form 
    *  Use `Manually type data` when the input is not available in the dataset
    *  Select the column where the input data can be fetched from the dataset
3. Click on `Confirm` to finalize the enrichment setup
4. Once the enrichment is setup, you will see a new column added to your table. This column allows you 
to run the enrichment on one individual row (i.e. Single run), or on the whole table (i.e. Bulk run) as shown in the image below.

<Tip>
It is highly recommended to try a Template/Tool on individual entries before a bulk run.
