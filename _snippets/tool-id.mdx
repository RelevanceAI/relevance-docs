There are different ways to find the ID of a Tool. The easiest way is to use the URL. For example 
when on the Tool and Use tab, the component before `use/app` and after project ID is the tool ID. The string 
below shows the URL structure:

`https://app.relevanceai.com/notebook/{region}/{project_id}/{tool_id}/use/app`

```Python
tool_id = "YOUR_TOOL_ID"
```
