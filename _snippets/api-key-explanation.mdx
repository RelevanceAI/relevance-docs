### What is an API Key?

Think of an API key as a **secure password** that lets the AI assistant access your account on your behalf. It's like giving the assistant a special key to your workspace so it can create, update, and manage things for you—without needing your actual login password.

**Why you need it:**
- The assistant needs permission to make changes in your account
- API keys are safer than sharing your password
- You can revoke the key anytime if needed
- Relevance AI encrypts and stores your key securely
