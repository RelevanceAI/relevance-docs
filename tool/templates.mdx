## What are tool templates?

Tool templates are pre-built tools made by the Relevance team and our builder community. We encourage you to use these as a starting point when creating agents and equipping them with tools to complete tasks. 

## Use a tool template

You can clone a tool template to make a copy of the desired template in your account, where you can modify it to better suit your needs.

Go to **Templates** and select the tool you want to clone.
