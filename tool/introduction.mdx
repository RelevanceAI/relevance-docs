## What are tools?

Tools are how you build integrations, LLM prompt chains or other step by step automations. You can build them in our no code tool builder. You can then share them as a form, run them in bulk on knowledge tables, or give them to your agents to help them complete work.

The possibilities are vast. You can tap into any API, choose from our extensive library of third-party integrations, or even incorporate custom code into your tools.

## Getting started

The Relevance **Tool Builder** consists of three tabs:

1. Use
2. Build
3. Logs 

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    position: 'relative',
    paddingTop: '56.25%',
  }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cm7oal74r0340hilg0k2ujcij"
    frameBorder="0"
    title="Build an AI agent from scratch in Relevance AI"
    allow="clipboard-write"
    webkitallowfullscreen="true"
    mozallowfullscreen="true"
    allowfullscreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%',
      border: '3px solid #5E43CE',
      borderRadius: '10px',
    }}/>
</div>

### Use

Use provides you with an interface that allows you to run and test a tool as a shareable app.

### Build

The builder is where you create your tool. 

You can define the inputs expected of the tool, for example, a file input and a text input.

Then, select from a library of steps and add them to your tool.

Each step can be ran individually, which is useful for testing and debugging your tool.

### Logs

The Logs tab is where you can view the logs of your tool, which is useful for reviewing executions.


### Share a tool

When building a tool, as the owner of the tool, you have full control over how you want it to be shared with
your colleagues or teammates.

By default, your tool is only accessible by you and your agents. Click on `Share` to: 

1. Create a sharable link for your tool.
2. Get an embeddable iframe for your tool.
3. Allow others to clone a copy of your tool.
