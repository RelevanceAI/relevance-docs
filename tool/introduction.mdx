You can use [ready-to-use templates](/templates/introduction) or
[create your own Tool](/build-custom-tools/create-a-tool).

In the following subsections and pages, we will explain all required steps and all the
available components to create a Tool.

## Getting started

The Notebook consists of three tabs:

1. Use
2. Build
3. Logs

### Use

Use provides you with an interface for your AI apps that let's you run and test them. Your inputs defined in the chain will be visible as a form and the output will be presented in our viewer which supports Markdown, HTML and Media.

There are different ways use an LLM app:

1. App
2. Run in bulk
3. Chat
4. Schedule
5. API

### Build

The builder is where you create your LLM chains. You can select from a library of transformations and add them as steps in the chain. You can also define the inputs expected of the chain, for example, a file input and a text input.

Each step in the chain can be ran individually in the Notebook. This is useful for testing and debugging your chain.

### Build a Tool

To build a Tool, click on `+ Create tool` located on top right of the [Tools](/get-started/key-concepts/tools) page.

### Share a Tool

By default your Tool is only accessible by you. However, wWhen clicked on `Share` you are provided with two
links:

- Sharable link: permission to use
