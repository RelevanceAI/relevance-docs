## What are tools?

Tools are how you build integrations, LLM prompt chains or other step by step automations. You can build them in our no code tool builder. You can then share them as a form, run them in bulk on knowledge tables, or give them to your agents to help them complete work.

The possibilities are vast. You can tap into any API, choose from our extensive library of third-party integrations, or even incorporate custom code into your tools.

## How Do Tools Work?

**Receive inputs**
Inputs define the data that a tool will process and act upon. Tools accept various types of inputs, such as text or numbers. These inputs can be provided manually by users or agents, or passed from other tools.

**Chain together steps**
Steps are the core actions that a tool performs. They can include operations like LLM prompts, API calls, or custom code execution. Steps are arranged in a logical sequence, with each step potentially using outputs from previous steps.

**Generate outputs**
After processing the inputs through its chain of steps, the tool produces one or more outputs. Outputs can be in various formats, such as text, links or HTML. These outputs can be displayed to users, stored in databases, or passed to other tools or agents for further processing.

## Getting started

The Relevance **Tool Builder** consists of three tabs:

1. Use
2. Build
3. Logs 

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    position: 'relative',
    paddingTop: '56.25%',
  }}>
  <iframe

    frameBorder="0"
    title="Build an AI agent from scratch in Relevance AI"
    allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen"
    webkitAllowFullscreen="true"
    mozAllowFullscreen="true"
    allowFullscreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%',
      border: '3px solid #5E43CE',
      borderRadius: '10px',
    }}/>
</div>

### Use

Use provides you with an interface that allows you to run and test a tool as a shareable app.

### Build

The builder is where you create your tool. 

You can define the inputs expected of the tool, for example, a file input and a text input.

Then, select from a library of steps and add them to your tool.

Each step can be ran individually, which is useful for testing and debugging your tool.

### Logs

The Logs tab is where you can view the logs of your tool, which is useful for reviewing executions.
