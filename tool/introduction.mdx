Tools are means of analysis powered by LLMs.
The capability, features and functionalities are nearly unlimited.
More importantly, Tools are flexible allowing you to build the analysis flow as you desire.
Some of the main features of Tools are listed below

1. Zero to low code
2. Super flexible
3. Customizable
4. Accurate relying on LLMs
5. Safe and secure
6. Easy to maintain
   To build a Tool, click on `+ Create tool` located on top right of the [Tools](/get-started/key-concepts/tools) page.

At Relevance, you can use [ready-to-use templates](/templates/introduction)
(i.e. Tools that are designed and maintained by Relevance) or
[create your own Tool](/build-custom-tools/create-a-tool).

In the following subsections and pages, we will explain all required steps and all the
available components to create a Tool.

<Tip>
  Tools that you design are saved under the
  [Tools](/get-started/key-concepts/tools) menu. Also listed on the
  [Home](/get-started/key-concepts/home) page.

## Getting started

The Notebook consists of three tabs:

1. Use
2. Build
3. Logs

### Use

Use provides you with an interface for your AI apps that let's you run and test them. Your inputs defined in the chain will be visible as a form and the output will be presented in our viewer which supports Markdown, HTML and Media.

There are different ways use an LLM app:

1. App
2. Run in bulk
3. Chat
4. Schedule
5. API

### Build

The builder is where you create your LLM chains. You can select from a library of transformations and add them as steps in the chain. You can also define the inputs expected of the chain, for example, a file input and a text input.

Each step in the chain can be ran individually in the Notebook. This is useful for testing and debugging your chain.

### Logs

The Logs tab is where you can view the logs of your chain. This is useful for seeing your executions.


### Build a Tool

Tools enable you to design and create your own analysis flow. Some of the main features of Tools are

1. Zero to low code
2. Super flexible
3. Customizable
4. Powered by Large language models such as GPT
5. Safe and secure with zero data footprint
6. Easy to maintain

To build a Tool, click on `+ Create tool` located on top right of the [Tools](/get-started/key-concepts/tools) page.

### Share a Tool

When building a Tool, as the owner of the Tool, you have full control on how you want it to be shared with
your colleagues or teammates.
By default your Tool is only accessible by you. However, wWhen clicked on `Share` you are provided with two
links:

- Sharable link: permission to use
- Template link: permission to use and modify
