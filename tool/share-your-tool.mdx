When building a tool, as the owner of the tool, you have full control over how you want it to be shared with your colleagues or teammates.

By default, your tool is only accessible by you and your agents. Click on `Share` to: 

1. Create a sharable link for your tool
2. Get an embeddable iframe for your tool
3. Allow others to clone a copy of your tool

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    position: 'relative',
    paddingTop: '56.25%',
  }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cm7ob1zzw0393hilgqrw8b0zy"
    frameBorder="0"
    title="Build an AI agent from scratch in Relevance AI"
    allow="clipboard-write"
    webkitallowfullscreen="true"
    mozallowfullscreen="true"
    allowfullscreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%',
      border: '3px solid #5E43CE',
      borderRadius: '10px',
    }}/>
</div>

## Sharable link

If you share your Tool as a sharable link, people you share your Tool with will be able to run your Tool from your account. 

<Warning>You will be charged for any Tool runs that those with access to your Tool perform.</Warning>

When sharing your Tool as a sharable link, you can select:
- A primary color for your form
- A guidance tip
- A Call to Action (CTA) button
- Relevance AI branding

## Embed your Tool

You can also embed your Tool onto a website so that users can run your Tool from your site / app.

<Warning>You will be charged for any Tool runs from those who run your Tool through your embedded iframe.</Warning>

When sharing your Tool as a sharable link, you can select:
- A primary color for your form
- A guidance tip

## Cloneable template

You can share a link to allow anyone with the link to clone your Tool to their Relevance AI project. This is the best option to use if you want to share your Tool with someone but do not want them using your project / credits. 

Once someone clones your tool to their project, their cloned tool will not be updated with any changes you make to it.
