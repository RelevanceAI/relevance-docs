The Firecrawl Tool step allows you to turn websites of your choosing into LLM-ready data that you can then feed into an LLM as part of your Tools and Agents. 

## Integrating with Firecrawl

In order to use the Firecrawl Tool step, you need to sign up for Firecrawl at [firecrawl.dev](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) and get an API key. You then need to add this API key to Relevance AI.
