## What is CQL?

CQL, or **Confluence Query Language**, is a powerful search language used in Confluence to retrieve content based on structured queries. It allows users to define precise criteria — such as content type, space, title, labels, or last modified date —when searching for pages, blog posts, or attachments. CQL is especially useful for advanced searches and automations, including filtering dynamic content in macros, building reports, or integrating with the Confluence Cloud REST API. Its syntax is similar to SQL, making it intuitive for users familiar with query languages. For example, `type=page AND label=marketing` would return all pages tagged with the "marketing" label.
