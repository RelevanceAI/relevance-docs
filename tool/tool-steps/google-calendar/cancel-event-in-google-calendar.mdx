<Accordion title="How come im not getting a response even though the event was successfully deleted?">
  You won’t receive a response after successfully deleting a calendar event because there’s nothing more to confirm—once it’s gone, it’s gone. If you run it again on the same event ID, it will let you know that the event has already been deleted.
