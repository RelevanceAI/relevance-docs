Relevance AI supports three different models for converting audio to text, and two for converting video to text. You can use one of these Tool steps which use different models:
- Deepgram (audio and video)
- AssemblyAI (audio and video)
- OpenAI (only audio)

By using these steps, you can convert your audio and video into readable text for other Tools to use.
