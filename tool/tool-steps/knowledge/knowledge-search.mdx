You can add the 'Knowledge Search' Tool step to your Tool by:

1. Creating a new Tool, then searching for the Knowledge Search Tool step.
2. Click "Expand" to see the full Tool step.
3. Select the Knowledge set to use.
4. Enter your search query in the **Query** field. 
5. Select the search type:
    - 	**Vector**: Finds results based on meaning (semantic similarity). Great when you want answers even if the exact words don’t match.
    - 	**Keyword**: Finds results based on exact word match. Useful when looking for specific terms or phrases.


## Advanced Settings

### Vector field
The vector field is the column used for searching your knowledge set using semantic similarity. By default, all fields are included unless you choose specific ones.

### Output all fields
- When enabled, all fields from your knowledge set will be shown - including the similarity score. 
- When disabled, only the main content field is returned.


### Page size
The number of results to return.

### Similarity threshold
All results are given a score between 0 and 1 based on how similar the result is to your query. This threshold is the minimum score for a result to be returned.

<Tip>Increase this value to get fewer but more accurate results. Lower it to be more inclusive.</Tip>
