You can add the 'Knowledge Search' Tool step to your Tool by:

1.  Creating a new Tool, then searching for the Knowledge Search Tool step.
2.  Click "Expand" to see the full Tool step.
3.  Select the Knowledge set to use.
4.  Enter your search query in the **Query** field.
5.  Select the search type:
    -     **Vector**: Finds results based on meaning (semantic similarity). Great when you want answers even if the exact words don’t match.
    -     **Keyword**: Finds results based on exact word match. Useful when looking for specific terms or phrases.

## Advanced Settings

### Vector field

The vector field is the column used for searching your knowledge set using semantic similarity. By default, all fields are included unless you choose specific ones.

### Output all fields

- When enabled, all fields from your knowledge set will be shown - including the similarity score.
- When disabled, only the main content field is returned.

### Page size

The number of results to return.

### Similarity threshold

All results are given a score between 0 and 1 based on how similar the result is to your query. This threshold is the minimum score for a result to be returned.

<Tip>
  Increase this value to get fewer but more accurate results. Lower it to be
  more inclusive.
</Tip>

### Raw filters

If you want to filter your search to a specific subset of entries in your knowledge set, you can use raw filters. Filters are defined as JSON objects.

**OR Logic with Arrays:** When using `exact_match` filter type, you can pass an array to the `condition_value` field to create OR semantics. This allows you to match records where the field equals ANY value in the array.

**Examples:**
- Single value: `"condition_value": "x"` → matches records where field equals x
- Array value: `"condition_value": ["a", "b"]` → matches records where field equals a OR b

**Example filter with OR logic:**
```json
{
  "field": "call_id",
  "filter_type": "exact_match",
  "condition": "==",
  "condition_value": ["45eb244f-5008-4b7f-bfab-6f4db2189d2e", "4a678557-700e-407f-ab62-23d0decf1b52"]
}
```

This filter will return results where `call_id` matches either of the two provided values.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between Knowledge Search and Advanced Knowledge Search?">
    - Knowledge Search is easier to use out of the box, with sensible default
    options that work well for most use cases. - [Advanced Knowledge
    Search](/tool/tool-steps/knowledge/advanced-knowledge-search) gives you
    greater control and fine-tuning capabilities for more precise retrieval —
    but may be slower in comparison.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When should I use Advanced Knowledge Search instead of the regular one?">
    - If you’re unsure which to choose, start with Knowledge Search. - Knowledge
    search works better out of the box, whilst advanced knowledge search gives
    you more control and fine-tuning options.
