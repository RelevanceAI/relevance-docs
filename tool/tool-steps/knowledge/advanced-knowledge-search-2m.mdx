## Advanced settings

### System prompt
The system prompt is the very first message in a conversation that instructs the model on its role or the personality of the AI. Examples can be expert researcher, analyst or tutor.

### Temperature
The temperature setting controls how “creative” or “random” the model’s responses will be. Lower temperatures make the model more focused and deterministic, while higher temperatures make it more creative and unpredictable.

### Enable Grounding
Grounding integrates Google Search results to inform and support the model’s responses.

### Page size
Page size controls the number of documents that will be retrieved from the knowledge set.
