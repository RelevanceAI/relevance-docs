There is a large amount of text data available on the net which can be an amazing source for tasks such as Q/A, research,
and context generation. Relevance provides you with an easy-to-use component for scraping website contents

## How to use the Extract website content step

### Add the component
You need to add the "Extract website content" step to your Tool (check how to get started with 
[creating a tool](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/getting-started)).

### Website URL

![Extract website content step](/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/web-scraping-fields.png)

Directly enter a URL in the box or use the `{{` to activate the variable mode. For instance, if the URL is in an input
component called `my_url`, use `{{my_url}}`. Or if the URL is the output of a Google-Search step, use `{{google.organic[0].link}}`
to access the url in the first search results ([FAQ](/build-custom-tools/faq#error-url-issue)).

### Method
You can specify if you wish to scrape data as Text or HTML. By default, Relevance scraps the Text.

### Element Selector
You can specify which element from the HTML components to scrape. By default, it is set to `body`.
Note that using `+ Add new`, you can specify a list of elements to be scrapped.

### Extra headers
If you need to provide special information to be able to scrape a website, provide the data as a JSON object.
The below object shows an example where an authentication token called `auth-token` and a `user-id` are required.

```
{
    "auth-token":"AUTHENTICATION-TOKEN",
    "user-id":"USER-ID"
}
```

<Snippet file="components/tools/step-general.mdx" />

## Access the step output
The output is a dictionary with two keys `page` and `selectors` containing the extracted text and if any selectors were used.
Below you can see samples where the default name assigned to the step `scrape` is used.
Note that a step name is different from the step title. Step titles can be found on the top left
of steps. A step name is shown on the bottom left, in smaller font and highlighted green.

```
scrape.output.page
scrape.output.selectors
```


## Common errors
### Wrong URL formatting
This error occurs when the URL field is set to a value that is not of type string. When using the output of another
step make sure, you access the URL field. Read more at [URL must be a string](/build-custom-tools/faq#error-url-issue).

### Non-array Elements
When setting up specific elements to be scrapped, make sure to use `+ Add new` to have more than one Element. And if the
button is clicked do not leave it as an empty list. Use the `x` icon to the right of the row to remove the extra line.
