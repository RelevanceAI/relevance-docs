## Using in an Agent

There are 3 ways to configure the tool step when using in an agent

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using dropdown menus">
    This is the easiest way to configure the tool step. You can select the Drive, Spreadsheet and Worksheet from a list of options via the dropdown menu.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Using input variables">
  This option offers the most flexibility - you can use the same tool step for multiple Google Sheets, however you will need to manually provide the necessary Google Sheet IDs.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mix of dropdown menus and input variables">
  This option offers the best of both worlds. You can use the dropdown menu to select the Drive, Spreadsheet and Worksheet, and then use an input variable for "Column Letter" and "Value" to allow the agent to work for different values.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What is the difference between using the green input variables and the dropdown menu?">
    **The dropdown menu is the easiest way to configure the tool step**. You can select the Drive, Spreadsheet and Worksheet from a list of options via the dropdown menu. 
    
    **The input variables offer more flexibility** e.g. you can use the same tool step for multiple Google Sheets, however you will need to manually provide the necessary Google Sheet IDs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use a mix of both dropdown menu and green input variables?">
    If you are using the tool in an agent, this is the recommended approach. You can use the dropdown menu to select the Drive, Spreadsheet and Worksheet that don't need to change, and then use the green input variables for "Column Letter" and "Value" to allow the agent to dynamically search for different values in your Google sheet.
    <Warning>If you are only using the input variables, you will need to provide the necessary Google Sheet IDs for the tool step to function properly.</Warning>
