## Using in an Agent

There are 3 ways to configure the tool step when using in an agent

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using dropdown menus">
    This is the easiest way to configure the tool step. You can select the Drive, Spreadsheet and Worksheet from a list of options via the dropdown menu. 

        ![Google Sheets Add multiple rows](/images/gs-add-multiple-rows-eg-1.png)
        

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Using input variables">
  This option offers the most flexibility - you can use the same tool step for multiple Google Sheets, however you will need to manually provide the necessary Google Sheet IDs.

    ![Google Sheets Add multiple rows](/images/gs-add-multiple-rows-eg-2.png)

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mix of dropdown menus and input variables">
  This option offers the best of both worlds. You can use the dropdown menu to select the Drive, Spreadsheet and Worksheet, and then use an input variable for "Row Values" to allow the agent to dynamically insert data to your Google sheet.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Parameters

<ParamField path="Drive" type="string">
  The Drive you want to use. By default, the tool uses "My Drive".
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Spreadsheet ID" type="string" required>
  To get the spreadsheet ID, navigate to your Google Sheet and copy the ID from the URL (the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`).
  <Tip> [You can use this tool to parse the worksheet, spreadsheet and drive IDs from a url](https://app.relevanceai.com/notebook/f1db6c/d64db999bc25-4ea0-b926-30b350f69243/01e4918b-6c0a-423d-8daa-a625ced25e23)</Tip>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Worksheet ID" type="string" required>
  To get the worksheet ID, open the specific worksheet you want to use and copy the ID from the URL (appears after `#gid=`).
  <Tip> [You can also use this tool to parse the worksheet, spreadsheet and drive IDs from a url](https://app.relevanceai.com/notebook/f1db6c/d64db999bc25-4ea0-b926-30b350f69243/01e4918b-6c0a-423d-8daa-a625ced25e23)</Tip>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Row Values" type="array of arrays" required>
  The data being inserted will need to be in an array of arrays format.
  
  **Example:** 
  ```json
  [
    ["John Doe", "john.doe@example.com", "123 Main St"], // row 1
    ["Jane Doe", "jane.doe@example.com", "456 Main St"] // row 2
    // ...
  ]
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Reset Row Formatting" type="boolean">
  If this option is unchecked, the format will be preserved when inserting data. If this option is checked, the data will be inserted as plain text.
</ParamField>

## What is an array of arrays?

An array is a data structure similar to a CSV row, where each element is separated by a comma, and the entire row is enclosed in square brackets.
An array can have many different types of data, including strings, numbers, <Tooltip tip="true or false">booleans</Tooltip>, and even other arrays.


```json
["Dog", 1, true]
```

An array of arrays is just multiple arrays put together. This is what an array of arrays looks like:

```json
[
  ["Column 1 Row 1", "Column 2 Row 1", "Column 3 Row 1"],
  ["Column 1 Row 2", "Column 2 Row 2", "Column 3 Row 2"],
  ["Column 1 Row 3", "Column 2 Row 3", "Column 3 Row 3"]
]
```
When you combine multiple arrays together, you can see that the data is structured like a Google Sheet.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What is the difference between using the green input variables and the dropdown menu?">
    **The dropdown menu is the easiest way to configure the tool step**. You can select the Drive, Spreadsheet and Worksheet from a list of options via the dropdown menu. 
    
    **The input variables offer more flexibility** e.g. you can use the same tool step for multiple Google Sheets, however you will need to manually provide the necessary Google Sheet IDs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use a mix of both dropdown menu and green input variables?">

    If you are using the tool in an agent, this is the recommended approach. You can use the dropdown menu to select the fields that don't need to change (the ID fields), and then use the green input variables for "Row Values" to allow the agent to dynamically retrieve data from your Google sheet.

    <Warning>If you are only using the input variables, you will need to provide the necessary Google Sheet IDs for the tool step to function properly. At the minimum, this includes the spreadsheet ID and the worksheet ID.</Warning>
