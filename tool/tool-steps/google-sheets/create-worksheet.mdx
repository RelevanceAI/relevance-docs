## Using in an Agent

There are 3 ways to configure the tool step when using in an agent

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using dropdown menus">
    This is the easiest way to configure the tool step. You can select the Drive and Spreadsheet from a list of options via the dropdown menu. 

        ![Google Sheets Create Worksheet](/images/gs-create-worksheet-eg-1.png)
        
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Using input variables">
  This option offers the most flexibility - you can use the same tool step for creating multiple worksheets, however you will need to manually provide the necessary Google Sheet IDs.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mix of dropdown menus and input variables">
  This option offers the best of both worlds. You can use the dropdown menu to select the Drive and Spreadsheet, and then use an input variable for "Title" to allow the agent to dynamically pick a name for the new worksheet.
