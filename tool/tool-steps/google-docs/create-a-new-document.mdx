<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I create a document with formatted text?">
    Currently, you can only create a new document with a blank template. However you can use this tool [Add/Update any content to Google Doc](https://app.relevanceai.com/marketplace/f1db6c/d64db999bc25-4ea0-b926-30b350f69243/search?search=Add/Update+any+content+to+Google+Doc&listing=e0a51c06-dccc-4eea-b8bc-40331ec41fbd) as a workaround to create a document with formatted text.
  </Accordion>
