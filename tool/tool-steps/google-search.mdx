The Google Search Tool step allows you to run a Google Search within your Tool, and use the outputs of this search in your LLM Tool steps. 

## Add the Google Search Tool step to your Tool

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative",paddingTop:"56.25%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmbt2atv9dqp7sn1rd6nr9vxx" frameBorder="0" title="Add the Google Search Tool step to your Tool" allow="clipboard-write" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />

You can add the Google Search Tool step to your Tool by:

1. Creating a new Tool, then click 'Google' under 'Steps'
2. Click 'Expand' to see the full Tool step
3. Add a Search Query to the field 
4. Run the Tool step to see if works with your configuration\!

## Advanced Settings

### Country
You can select which country / region you would like to search Google from. 

### Locale
You can select which language is set for the Google Search. 

## Tool step outputs

The Google Search Tool step allows you to access the organic search (as an array) completed on the search query entered, as well as:
- **People Also Ask**: you can access an array of questions searchers also ask about the query, as well as a snippet, title and link for each question
- **Related searches**: you can also access an array of related searches to the search query

If you wanted to use an LLM Tool step to then analyse these results, here is an example of how you could prompt engineer this, where `search_query` is the input variable used for the Google Search, and `google` is the variable for the Google Search Tool step. 

```markdown
You are analysing the Google results for the following query: {{search_query}}

A Google Search has already been completed for this query, and Google has returned the following info:

* People Also Ask: {{google.peopleAlsoAsk}}
* Related Searches: {{google.relatedSearches}}
* All of the latest search results: {{google.organic}}

Analyse these to give me a run down of the top results from the {{search_query}}, as well as what people are asking about this query, and related searches. Keep this analysis between 1 - 3 paragraphs.
