"Spreadsheet to JSON" allows you to convert a table like data (e.g. a CSV file) to its corresponding JSON format.
JSONs are very easy to use in code steps.

## How to use Convert a spreadsheet to JSON

### Add the component
Add the Spreadsheet to JSON converter step to your Tool (check how to get started with 
[creating a tool](/tool/tool-steps/getting-started)).

### File URL
A "Spreadsheet to JSON" converter requires a file as an input. If your file is publicly accessible on the web (i.e. with no 
authentication or sign-up requirement), simply provide the URL directly or as a 
[text input](/tool/user-inputs/text-input). Otherwise, you will need to add a 
[File-to-URL](/tool/user-inputs/file-to-url) input.
In either situation, use the `{{variable name}}` to provide the data to the converter.

## Access the step output
The output is a dictionary with a key `rows`. 
* `spreadsheet_to_json[rows]` is a list containing as many rows as included in the uploaded file.
* Each row is a dictionary representing one row of data (i.e. keys are column headers in the uploaded spreadsheet).

Below you can see samples where the default name assigned to the step `spreadsheet_to_json` is used.
Note that a step name is different from the step title. Step titles can be found on the top left
of steps. A step name is shown on the bottom left, in smaller font and highlighted green.
