## Using the Tool output

The output is a dictionary with a key `rows`.

- `spreadsheet_to_json[rows]` is a list containing as many rows as included in the uploaded file.
- Each row is a dictionary representing one row of data (i.e. keys are column headers in the uploaded spreadsheet).

Below you can see samples where the default name assigned to the step `spreadsheet_to_json` is used.

```
spreadsheet_to_json.rows
spreadsheet_to_json.rows[0]
```
