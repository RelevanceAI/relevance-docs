## Advanced Settings

### Use OCR

OCR (Optical character recognition or optical character reader) is needed for image PDFs (e.g. scanned data). This option uses more credits and therefore should only be activated for image PDFs.

<Warning>This will not return images in the PDFs you upload, but will convert text in images to text for you to use in your Tools.</Warning>

### OCR Type

This allows you to choose the model used if 'Use OCR' is selected. The options available are:
- Fast model (~95% accuracy)
- Quality model (~99% accuracy but slow)

### Return PDF Text as Documents (List of Texts)

This can only be selected if 'Use OCR is selected'. 

Toggling this will either return the PDF text as an aggregated text or as a list of texts.
