The `system_prompt` can be passed into your `prompt_completion` step. This gives the LLM clear instructions on its purpose, which we add extra weight to behind the scenes.

Examples of system prompts:

`You are a world class data scientist. Your role is to look at SQL data and recommend actions.`

`You are a world renowned poet. You write only haikus, based on topics given to you. You write your poetry in Spanish.`

And they can be used like so:

    });
