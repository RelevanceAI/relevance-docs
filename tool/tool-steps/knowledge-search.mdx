A vectorized dataset can be used in a Knowledge search where you look for specific entries relevant to a query.

<Tip>
If you have not enabled knowledge in the process of 
uploading your dataset, go to [Data](/get-started/key-concepts/knowledge) 
page, switch from "Knowledge" to "Datasets", use the `Vectorize` button on the top to vectorize your data.
If you use other options than knowledge, you will see the name of the vector field as shown in the image
below.

</Tip>

## How to use the Knowledge search step
### Add the component
You need to add the "Knowledge search" step to your Tool (check how to get started with 
[creating a tool](/tool/tool-steps/getting-started)).
![Knowledge search](/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/knowledge-search-get-started.png)

### Knowledge Source
![Knowledge search](/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/knowledge-search-fields.png)

Select the target dataset (datasets containing at least a vector field) from the drop-down menu.
You can also select "All knowledge sets" to perform the search across all the uploaded and vectorized data.

<Tip>
Only use "All knowledge sets" if they all contain relevant data.
</Tip>

### Query
The query is your reference to what you want from your data; it is similar to what you type in Google when performing
web searches.
Form your queries wisely, not too long, not too short, precisely mention what needs to be fetched from the data.

### Search type
* Keyword: This search is suitable for word/phrase matching.
* Vector search: This search is suitable for semantic search and looking not just at words but at the concept.

<Tip>
Use word matching when looking for specific words, or even IDs such as model number or response id.
</Tip>

### Model
This is the model used for vectorizing your data. By default, Relevance uses the MpNet model for enabling knowledge.
So, if you have vectorized your data with a model other than MpNet, make sure to select the model from the drop-down
menu, otherwise, you do not need to make any selection.


### Content field
You can select which specific column in your knowledge table be searched. Enter the name of the column (i.e. the header)
** EXACTLY ** as seen in the table.
If you do not select any field, Relevance searches across the whole dataset (Keyword), the first vector field (Vector).

<Tip>
When uploading a CSV file knowing one column will be used for search, it is better to only select that target column when
enabling knowledge, instead of selecting all columns.
</Tip>

### Page size
After a search query finalizes, you can specify, how many of the top matching results should be returned as the Search
result.

### Raw filters
If you wish to look at a subset of entries in your dataset and perform a search on that subset, you can set raw filters.
Keep in mind you must form your filters as JSON objects.
![Raw filters](/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/knowledge-search-filters.png)

<Tip>
* Supported operators and conditions: `==`, `!=`, `neq`, `<=`, `>=`, `<` and `>`.\n* The `AND` logic is applied when multiple filters are used (i.e. a list of filters).
</Tip>

**OR Logic with Arrays:** When using `exact_match` filter type, you can pass an array to the `condition_value` field to create OR semantics. This allows you to match records where the field equals ANY value in the array.

**Examples:**
- Single value: `"condition_value": "x"` → matches records where field equals x
- Array value: `"condition_value": ["a", "b"]` → matches records where field equals a OR b

## Access the step output
The output is a dictionary with two keys `results` and `documents` containing the extracted relevant chunks of text from the knowledge set
and the full documents respectively.
Below you can see samples where the default name assigned to the step `vector_search` is used.
Note that a step name is different from the step title. Step titles can be found on the top left
of steps. A step name is shown on the bottom left, in smaller font and highlighted green.

`vector_search.results`
`vector_search.documents`
