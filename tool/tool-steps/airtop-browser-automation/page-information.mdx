8. **Check Interval Seconds** (Optional): Enter how frequently (in seconds) to check for the condition. Smaller intervals check more frequently but may use more resources.
9. Clicking `Run step` to test out the Tool

The step continuously monitors the page for the specified condition. Once the condition is met (or the timeout is reached), the step completes. This is useful for waiting for dynamic content to load or for specific page states to occur.
