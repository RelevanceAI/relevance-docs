## Outputs

Outputs are the data that your tool returns. They're the result of your tool's actions.

By default, what you see will be the output of the last step in the tool, however you can also configure this.

A common reason to configure tool outputs is to control your agent's context, as everything your tool outputs will enter the context of your agent - it's a good idea to manually configure tool to only output what matters.

For example, if your tool returns the results of a Google search step, you probably don't want to dilute your agent's context with suggested searches and 'people also ask', so you should probably configure a manual output to return the results output only.
