## Inputs

Inputs are the data that your tool needs to perform its action. They're provided by the user of the tool, be that a human, an agent or another tool.

### Types

An input has a content 'type'. For example you may want an 'age' input to be a number or a 'name' input to be text.

**Text input:** This is a basic text field. Use this for short answers, names, or simple queries. Think of it as a single-line text box.

**Long text input:** Use this for paragraphs, like detailed descriptions or long-form content.

**Options dropdown:** A classic dropdown menu. Great for when you want users to pick from a predefined list of options.

**Numeric input:** For when you need numbers. It might look like a text input, but it'll only accept digits.

**Checkbox:** This is a yes/no, true/false, on/off input. Perfect for simple toggles or confirmations.

**Text list:** This allows users to input multiple text items, usually one per line.

**JSON:** This accepts JSON-formatted data, great for structured information.

**List of JSONs:** For when you need multiple JSON objects in a list format.

**File to text:** This takes a file upload and converts its content to text. Handy for processing document contents.

**File to URL:** Upload a file, get a URL. It's like giving your file a web address.

**Multiple files to URLs:** Same as above, but for multiple files. Each file gets its own URL.

**Table:** This input type allows for structured data in rows and columns, like a spreadsheet.

**API key:** A secure way to input API keys.

**Knowledge table:** A way to input or select from predefined knowledge bases.

**OAuth account:** For when you need to connect to other services securely. It handles the 'Allow access' dance with other platforms.

To create an input select an input type. Give your input a name and a description, and variable name.

### Using default values to create constants

In the Relevance Tool Builder, default values allow you to pre-set inputs for your tools, offering a way to establish constants, streamline testing, and improve overall tool efficiency.

**What are default values?**

Default values are predetermined inputs that you can set for any parameter in your tool. When a tool runs, these values will be automatically filled in unless explicitly overridden.

**Key uses of default values**

Establishing constants: Create values that remain consistent across multiple tool runs. This is useful for API keys, base URLs, or any standard parameters your tool frequently uses.
Providing example inputs: Set up realistic sample data for testing purposes. This helps in quickly demonstrating how the tool works without manual input each time.
Setting up frequently used values: Streamline tool usage by pre-filling common inputs. This reduces the chance of user error in repetitive tasks.

**Setting default values**

In the Tool Builder interface, locate the input field you want to set a default for. Enter or select the desired default value, then click set “Set value as default”.
