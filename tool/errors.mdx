### Error: Wrong chat history setup

Below errors can occur when "Conversation history" is not set correctly.

![LLM - conversation History](/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/llm-conversation-history.png)

```
Studio transformation prompt_completion input validation error: must be array {"type":"array"} /history
```

Provide values for the conversation or use the `x` to remove it

```
Studio transformation prompt_completion input validation error: must be equal to one of the allowed values {"allowedValues":["user","ai","function"]} /history/0/role
```

Note that the only allowed roles are `ai` and `user`.

### Error: Rate limit

```
429:
      {"message":"Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
      in organization org-JfRBhZhDGaEQPgWeVxj3OEGF on tokens per min. Limit: 180000
      / min. Current: 1 / min. Contact us through our help center at
      help.openai.com if you continue to have
      issues.","type":"tokens","param":null,"code":"rate_limit_exceeded"}
```

This error happens when the used API key is set to a different rate limit compared to what Relevance uses by default.
Trying again with different intervals of pause helps with this issue.

### Error: URL issue

This error occurs when the input to "Extract website content" receives an input parameter that is not of type string (e.g. a URL).

```
Studio transformation browserless_scrape input validation error: must be string {"type":"string"} /website_url
```

![Extract website content](/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/extract-website-content.png)

A common situation where this happens is when the output of another step (e.g. Google search as shown below) is used as the input to "Extract website content".
If the output is a list or an object similar to the example below, you need to access the URL field.

![Google search](/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/google-search-output.png)

In our example, we can access the string URLs in three ways:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Access one URL in the results">
    If the above result is the output of a `google search` step, accessing the
    first link is via `google.organic[0].link`
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="For Loop">
    If you wish to check all the items in the returned results, enable `foreach`
    options ![Enable
    foreach](/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/for-each-access.png) And
    specify the source list and the name of the field you wish to access in each
    item of the list. ![list
    access](/images/build-custom-tools/tool-step/extract-website-content-for-each.png)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="LLM to extract URL">
    The output of Google search can be used as the input to a LLM instructed to
    extract and return only the first URL.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Error: Validators

At Relevance, you can [set up validators](tool/tool-steps/llms/llm-tool-step) for your LLM component to ensure that the output
follows the desired format. The below error happens when the LLM's output does not meet the criteria. Prompt engineering is the best way to
handle such as situation. Try rewording your prompt and providing examples.

```
Prompt completion did not pass validation
```

### Error: Credits

The following error indicates that the credits are below zero and you need to top up to be able to continue using the platform.

```
Organization Entitlement setting negative_credits : {"limit":-10000} does not allow this action.
```
