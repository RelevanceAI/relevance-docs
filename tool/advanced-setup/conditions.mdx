By default, when running a Tool, each tool step is executed once. However, Relevance supports conditional execution. Where 
a step runs only if the defined condition is met

## Conditions

Access loops under the three-dot menu on the top right of steps. Click on **Enable conditions**.

Conditions must follow Javascript syntax and must be written inside the template handlebars `{{ condition }}`. 

<Tip>
You can use `&&` and `||` for "and" and "or", respectively. 
</Tip>

In the example below, the LLM step runs if the input variable `age` is 30 (`{{ age === 30 }}`) and the input variable 
`gender` is female (`{{ gender === "female" }}`).
