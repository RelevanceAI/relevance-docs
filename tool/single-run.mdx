Every Tool can be applied to single entries (i.e. Single run) or on all entries in a dataset (i.e. a bulk run).
Single run helps you understand the Tool, its input and output and credit cost. Therefore, it is recommended to use the Single run option
first before a bulk run.

On this page, we will explain different ways of accessing Single run for a Tool.
