Every Template can be applied to single entries (i.e. Single run) or on all entries in a dataset (i.e. [Bulk run](/templates/bulk-run)).
Single run helps you understand the Template, its input and output and credit cost. Therefore, it is recommended to use the Single run option
first before a [Bulk run](/templates/bulk-run).

On this page, we will explain different ways of accessing Single run for a Template.
