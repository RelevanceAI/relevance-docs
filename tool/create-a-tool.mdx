This guide walks you through creating a Tool. For an overview of what Tools are and how they work, see [Tools](/tool/introduction).

## Two ways to create

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Invent" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Describe what you want in plain language and the platform generates a working Tool for you. Great for getting started fast — you make the tweaks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Build from scratch" icon="hammer">
    Full step-by-step control over inputs, steps, and outputs. Ideal when you have a specific workflow in mind or need precision.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Option 1: Invent a Tool

1. Click **Tools** in the left sidebar
2. Click **+ New Tool**
3. Select **Invent**
4. Describe what the Tool should do — be specific about the input it receives, the action it performs, and the output you expect
5. Review the generated Tool — Inventor will set up the inputs, steps, and outputs for you
6. Test and tweak as needed

## Option 2: Build from scratch

1. Click **Tools** in the left sidebar
2. Click **+ New Tool**
3. Select **Start from scratch**
4. Give your Tool a name and description, then click **Edit agent prompt** to describe how an Agent should use the Tool
5. Add your **inputs** — what data does the Tool need to receive?
6. Add **steps** — what should the Tool do with that data? Steps include LLM prompts, API calls, integrations, code execution, and more
7. Define your **outputs** — what should the Tool return when it's done?
8. Run individual steps to test as you build
9. Give the Tool to an Agent or [share it](/tool/share-your-tool) as a standalone form

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    position: 'relative',
    paddingTop: '56.25%',
  }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cm7obxeh703xihilguwnkradd"
    frameBorder="0"
    title="Build an AI agent from scratch in Relevance AI"
    allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen"
    webkitAllowFullscreen="true"
    mozAllowFullscreen="true"
    allowFullscreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%',
      border: '3px solid #5E43CE',
      borderRadius: '10px',
    }}/>
</div>

## The Tool Builder

![The Tool Builder — switch between Use, Build, and Logs tabs.](/images/tool-builder-tabs.png)

The Tool Builder has three tabs:

- **Use** — run and test your Tool as a shareable form
- **Build** — create your Tool by defining inputs and chaining steps together
- **Logs** — review past executions and debug issues

## What's next?

Once you've created a Tool, explore the rest of the build guides to refine it:

- [Style guide](/tool/customize-tool/tool-style-guide) — naming conventions and best practices for making Tools work well with Agents
- [Inputs](/tool/customize-tool/inputs) — configure what data your Tool receives
- [Steps](/tool/customize-tool/steps) — chain actions together into a workflow
- [Outputs](/tool/customize-tool/outputs) — define what your Tool returns
