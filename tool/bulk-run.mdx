Every Tool can be applied to single entries (i.e. Single run) or on all entries in a dataset (i.e. Bulk run).
Single run helps you understand the Tool, its input and output and credit cost. Therefore, it is recommended to use the single run option first before a bulk run.

On this page, we will explain different ways of accessing Bulk run for a Tool.
