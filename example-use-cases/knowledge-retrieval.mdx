Ever wondered what if we could provide all the PDF files containing company rules and regulations
as the background knowledge to a large language model such as GPT and have it as an agent to reply 
our queries?
At Relevance, it is not a wonder anymore. We can actually build such an agent in the matter of minutes, 
even embed it to a websites.

## What do we need
1. **Data**

    Collect all sources of data that you want to provide the LLM as knowledge.
    Note that you are not limited to PDF when providing your knowledge. Even Audio/Video files (e.g. user guides)
    can be the knowledge source.

    <Tip>
    No need to worry about OCR or transcription. Relevance will automatically take care of such steps.
    </Tip>

2. **Tool configuration**

    Put together a Tool that 
        1. receives knowledge
        2. receives question
        3. provides the best answer from the knowledge to the question

## Let's build a knowledge retrieval Tool
1. Start with clicking on `+ Create tool` located on top right of the [Tools](/get-started/key-concepts/tools) page.
For more information see [how to create a tool](/build-custom-tools/introduction).
2. Click on `+ Add data` on the knowledge section to [add knowledge](/build-custom-tools/knowledge/knowledge) to your Tool. 
Note that you can upload knowledge sources to your Tool directly from the add knowledge window, or select already 
existing data tables on your accounts.
<Tip>
Make sure to [enable knowledge](/data/data-tables#enable-knowledge) (i.e. vectorize your data). Vectors allow semantic 
search (as opposed to word-matching) and increase the accuracy of knowledge retrieval. 
</Tip>
3. Add a [text input](/build-custom-tools/user-inputs/text-input) component which will carry the query/question. Lets call
it `query`. Your Tool must be similar to the image below.
![knowledge and input](/example-use-cases/knowledge-retrieval-1.png)
4. Add an [LLM](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/llms/llm) component.
* **The prompt**
    
    Use `{{}}` and the component names (i.e. `knowledge` and `query` in our current example) to bring the knowledge and the 
    question to the prompt. Provide precise instruction on what you need from the model. For example a very simple prompt
    could be
    ```
    Context: """ {{knowledge}} """
    Goal:
    Use the above Context and nothing else and answer the question below.
    Question: {{query}}
    ```

* **Handling large amount of data**

    We know that LLMs come with limitations on the number of tokens included in the prompt.
    Dealing with large amount of text such as rules and regulations, and trying to answer questions,
    we need to stick to most relevant data.
    Under LLM advanced options, under "How to handle too much content", click on `Edit` located in front 
    of `knowledge`. By default we select most relevant data using vector search. But it is recommended to 
    set it up manually. 
    ![knowledge and input](/images/example-use-cases/knowledge-retrieval-2.png)
    With `Most relevant data` selected, click on "Advanced options" and type `{{query}}` (i.e. name of the component
    containing our question) to filter out any non-relevant information to the query. More details are provided at
    [How to handle too much text](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/llms/how-to-handle-too-much-text).

* **System prompt**

    Scroll further down and under "System prompt", give some characteristics to your knowledge retrival agent.
    For instance:
    ```
    You are an expert in rules and regulation in company XYZ. You will answer questions based on the provided
    knowledge and ...
    ```
    or 
    ```
    You are an expert in knowledge retrieval from large sources of data. You will answer questions precisely based on the provided knowledge.
    ```

* **Output**

    Click on LLM output button (located on the top right of the component) if you wish to modify the output. `Answer`
    is the main output, the rest provide you with information regarding the execution and can be safely deleted.

5. Save the Tool using the button on the top right of the page and you are ready to enter your query and get
responses from your knowledge retrieval large language model.
