## Loading your PDFs

The first thing we need to do is index our PDFs in some sort of database. Ideally, we actually want this to be a vector database - where we can store embeddings for the PDF text.

<Snippet file="vector-db-explanation.mdx" />

### Loading PDFs into our built-in vector database

Good news! Relevance has a built in vector database. We call these "datasets". We want to:

1. Scrape PDFs from URLs
2. Split up the PDF text into chunks
3. Create embeddings with OpenAI for each chunk
4. Upload the chunks into a Relevance AI dataset

<Tip>
    We'll be creating more tooling and content around this process, but for now
    you can run this [Google Colab
    demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XYaRamHmHop3GV4MGTMaDZjRZuWfMy9O?usp=sharing).

## Planning the chain

Now let's build the chain. We want it to:

1. Receive a question
2. Use the question to search our vector database for relevant text chunks from our PDFs
3. Feed those chunks into the LLM as context, and have the LLM answer our question

Additionally, we want the chain to be able to consider the chat history when answering questions. This will allow us to have a conversation, like with ChatGPT.

To do that, we need to alter our chain to also accept a history param. The trick is, we want to use that history to re-word the user's question.

So for example, if their question is "What's that in fahrenheit?" - standalone, this will make no sense to the LLM. However, if we have just asked the LLM "what is the boiling point of water in celsius?", by passing in the history, we can re-word the new question to "what is the boiling point of water in fahrenheit?". An LLM is able to answer that successfully!

So with that in mind, our chain should look like:

1. Receive a question and chat history
2. If chat history exists, use an LLM to reword the question based on the history
3. Use the question to search our vector database for relevant text chunks from our PDFs
4. Feed those chunks into the LLM as context, and have the LLM answer our question

## Defining our chain input

Let's start by creating a new file in the `chains` folder called `pdf-chat.js`. This will be our chain!

We start by importing the `defineChain` method from the `@relevanceai/chain` package:

```js
import { defineChain } from '@relevanceai/chain';

const chain = defineChain({
    title: 'PDF Q&A',
});
```

Next, we want to define the input parameters for this chain. As discussed, those should be `question` and `history`. We then give the params types, based on [JSONSchema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html).

```js
const chain = defineChain({
    title: 'PDF Q&A',
    params: {
        question: {
            type: 'string',
        },
        history: {
            type: 'array',
            items: {
                type: 'object',
                properties: {
                    message: {
                        type: 'string',
                    },
                    role: {
                        type: 'string', // either 'user' or 'ai'
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    },
});
```

Our history will be an array of objects, with the message and who sent the message (`role`).

## Defining our chain steps

<Snippet file="chain-steps-introduction.mdx" />

To build this chain, we'll need to use the following steps as specified earlier:

1. Modify question based on chat history
2. Search vector database for relevant text chunks
3. Feed chunks into LLM and get answer

We do this in the `setup` function in `defineChain`, which receives `params` and a `step` function as arguments. The `step` function is used to define the steps of the chain.

<Snippet file="setup-code-warning.mdx" />

```ts
const chain = defineChain({
    ...restOfChain,
    setup({ params, step, code, runIf }) {
        // steps go here
        const { question, history } = params;

        // use an LLM to modify the question
        const { modifiedQuestion } = runIf(history, () => {
            // wrap our custom Javascript function in our code utility
            const { transformed: reducedHistory } = code(
                { history },
                ({ history }) =>
                    history.reduce(
                        (acc, item) =>
                            `${acc}\n${
                                item.role === 'ai' ? 'ASSISTANT' : 'USER'
                            }: ${item.message}\n`,
                        ''
                    )
            );

            const { answer: modifiedQuestion } = step('prompt_completion', {
                prompt: `The human is having a conversation with an assistant, where the assistant will query a knowledgebase to get the context needed to provide an answer. You must use the chat history and the follow-up input to rephrase the question such that it can be used on its own. This means the standalone question must be include context from the chat history necessary to provide an answer.

            For example, if the chat history contains information about the temperature and the user asks to convert it into another unit - provide that in the standalone question. Or if the user asks a question about a subject from the history, reference that subject with detail.

            Chat History: ${reducedHistory}

            Follow Up Input: ${question}.

            Standalone question:`,
            });

            return { modifiedQuestion };
        });

        const { transformed: questionTransform } = code(
            { history, modifiedQuestion, question },
            ({ history, modifiedQuestion, question }) => {
                return {
                    question:
                        history && history.length
                            ? modifiedQuestion
                            : (question as string),
                };
            }
        );

        const questionToUse = questionTransform.question;

        // Step 2. search vector database for relevant text chunks
        const { results: vectorSearchResults } = step('search', {
            query: questionToUse,
            dataset_id: 'knowledge_base',
            vector_field: 'embedding_vector_',
            model: 'text-embedding-ada-002',
            page_size: 3,
        });

        const { transformed: searchTransformed } = code(
            { vectorSearchResults },
            ({ vectorSearchResults }) => {
                return {
                    results: vectorSearchResults.map(
                        (result: Record<string, any>) => ({
                            text: result.text,
                            url: result.pdf_url,
                        })
                    ),
                };
            }
        );

        const resultsMapped = searchTransformed.results;

        // Step 3. ask LLM, injecting vector database results as context
        const { answer } = step('prompt_completion', {
            prompt: `Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end in JSON. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. Provide a reference to the "pdf_url" of the items used to give the answer. The response must be JSON using the format "{ answer, references: [url] }".

${resultsMapped}

Question: ${questionToUse}

Helpful Answer JSON:`,
        });

        // finally, let's convert the answer to JSON
        const { transformed: answerJSON } = code({ answer }, ({ answer }) => {
            let returnAnswer = {
                answer: "I couldn't answer the question. Please try again.",
                references: [],
            };

            try {
                // try to convert the LLM's answer into JSON
                returnAnswer = JSON.parse(answer);
            } catch (err) {}

            return returnAnswer;
        });

        return {
            answer: answerJSON,
        };
    },
});
```

## Demo

Let's show off how to run this bad boy client side! I've created a simple Nuxt.js application containing the above chain and a chat frontend. You're free to [clone](/templates/introduction#clone-a-template-create-a-copy-of-a-tool-in-your-account) this template and use it as a starting point for your own projects.

[Check it out here!](https://github.com/RelevanceAI/template-ask-relevance-chat)

To get it working with your own chain, make sure to:

```bash
relevance login
relevance deploy
```

The relevant code exists in the `useChain` composable. We run the chain by it's ID, which is the file name of the chain.

```ts
import { Client } from '@relevance-ai/chain';

// we can import the type for the chain to get type safety (optional)
import type PdfQa from './chains/pdf-qa.ts';

const client = new Client({
    regionId: REGION_ID,
    projectId: PROJECT_ID,
});

const response = await client.runChain<typeof PdfQa>('pdf-qa', {
    question: clonedUserInput,
    history: chatHistory.value,
});

const responseAnswer = response.answer;
```
