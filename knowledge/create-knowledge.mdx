## How to create a knowledge table

There are a couple of ways to create a knowledge table.

**Blank:** Start with an empty table and manually input your data.
Click on “Blank” and name your table. Click on “Add column”, then “Blank column”, then enter a name, select a column type and create your column. Click “Add row” to enter data.

**Upload from CSV:** Import structured data from a CSV file.
Select "Upload from CSV". Choose your CSV file and hit “Upload data to table”.


**Import from website:** Automatically extract and structure data from a specified website.
Enter the name of your table, and URL of the website you want to import from. Select the type of content to extract (text or HTML).

**Import from 3rd Party:** Connect to third-party services to import relevant data.
Choose from available third-party integrations.
For example, if you select “Slack”, then enter your API key, select the channel you want to important from, and the number of messages.

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    position: 'relative',
    paddingTop: '61.46%',
  }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/f8ptogwfln"
    frameBorder="0"
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%',
      borderRadius: '10px',
    }}/>
</div>

## Show/Hide columns
Click on the `n Hidden` button will provide you with a list of columns included in your table and an on/off toggle. Another way to 
Hide a column is to click on the header and choose "Hide".

## Download
You can export your data and the analysis results in [standard format](/templates/export#export-to-csv) (i.e. as seen in the table)
or [wide format](/templates/export#export-wide-format) (i.e. flattened categorical fields).

## Add rows
If you wish to manually add new rows to your data table, click on `Add rows` located under the table. When hovering over a cell in 
the newly added row, the "full screen" icon (i.e. square with 4 arrows) appears which provides you with edit mode to type in values.

## Add columns
If you wish to manually add new columns to your data table, click on `Add columns` located to the right of your table. 

<Tip>
When modifying rows or columns in a table:
* Do not forget to hit save which appears on the top right of the table.
* You can use the "Clear changes" button that appears on the top, to undo your changes to the latest saved state.
</Tip>

## Delete a column
Click on the header and select "Delete" from the appeared list. Keep in mind that this action is not reversible.

## Rename a column
Click on the header and select and you can see that the header appears in a text-box. Simply modify the text to rename a column.
