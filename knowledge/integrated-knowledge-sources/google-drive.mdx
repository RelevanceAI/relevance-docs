  <Accordion title="Is there a file size limit for Google Drive files added to Knowledge?">
    Yes, there is a limit of 50MB. If you try to select a file that exceeds the 50mb limit, you'll receive an error message indicating that the file is too large.

  <Accordion title="What should I do if my agent fails to fetch data from Google Drive?">
    If your agent fails to fetch data, you'll see an error notification indicating the failed fetch.

If the problem persists, try reconnecting your Google Drive or reach out for further assistance.
