  <Accordion title="Will any changes I make to my Sharepoint files be reflected in Relevance AI?">
    Yes, our automatic content syncing feature ensures that any documents you upload initially, as well as any changes made to those files in SharePoint, are automatically updated in your agent's knowledge store. This means you won't have to worry about manually syncing files every time there's an update; it all happens seamlessly in the background.
