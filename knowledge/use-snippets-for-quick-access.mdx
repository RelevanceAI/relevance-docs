## Overview

 This powerful feature provides a centralized way to store and reference reusable text variables that can be used throughout your tools and agents. By creating a single source of truth for commonly used text elements, Snippets eliminate redundant updates and streamline your workflow.

Whether you're managing company names, standard greetings, or complex message templates, Snippets make your text management more efficient and consistent across your entire AI ecosystem.

## Key Benefits

Snippets deliver several important advantages that enhance your workflow:

- **Centralized Text Management** – Store common strings (company names, greetings, standard messages) in one accessible location.
- **Universal Availability** – Use snippets anywhere a variable is accepted, including agents and tool inputs.
- **Single-Source Updates** – Edit once and update everywhere, eliminating the need to manually change the same text across multiple tools.
- **Simplified Architecture** – Eliminate 'prop-drilling' by making shared text easily accessible throughout your workspace.

## How It Works

Snippets integrate seamlessly into your existing workflow:

1. **Define a Snippet**: Create a named text variable in the Snippets section.
2. **Reference in Tools and Agents**: Use the `snippets.` prefix followed by your snippet name to reference it anywhere variables are accepted.
3. **Update Centrally**: When you need to change the text, update it once in the Snippets section, and the change propagates everywhere it's used.

For example, you can reference a snippet using this syntax: `{{ snippets.company_name }}`

## Getting Started

Accessing and using Snippets is straightforward:

1. Navigate to the Snippets section in the left sidebar of your Relevance AI workspace
2. Click "Create New Snippet"
3. Provide a descriptive name and the text content for your snippet
4. Save your snippet
5. Reference your snippet in tools and agents using the `{{ snippets.your_snippet_name }}` syntax

## Best Practices

To get the most out of Snippets, consider these recommended practices:

- **Use Descriptive Names**: Choose clear, intuitive names that indicate the snippet's purpose (e.g., `company_name`, `support_email`, `legal_disclaimer`).
- **Categorize Related Snippets**: Use naming conventions to group related snippets (e.g., `email_header`, `email_signature`).
- **Document Usage**: Add comments within your tools and agents to indicate where snippets are being used.
- **Audit Regularly**: Periodically review your snippets to ensure they contain up-to-date information.
- **Consider Scope**: Create snippets for text that appears in multiple places or might need updating across tools.

## Use Cases

Snippets are particularly valuable in these scenarios:

- **Brand Consistency**: Maintain consistent company names, taglines, and messaging across all AI interactions.
- **Contact Information**: Store email addresses, phone numbers, and URLs that might change over time.
- **Standard Messages**: Create reusable templates for common responses, greetings, or disclaimers.
- **Compliance Text**: Manage legal disclaimers, privacy statements, or terms of service that must be consistent.
- **Personalization Elements**: Store reusable personalization templates that can be combined with dynamic data.

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Company Information

```
// Define snippets
snippets.company_name = "Acme Corporation"
snippets.support_email = "support@acmecorp.com"
snippets.company_tagline = "Innovating for tomorrow, today."

// Use in agent prompt
"Thank you for contacting {{ snippets.company_name }}.
Our mission is {{ snippets.company_tagline }}
For additional support, please email {{ snippets.support_email }}."

```

### Example 2: Email Templates

```
// Define snippets
snippets.email_greeting = "Hello and thank you for reaching out,"
snippets.email_signature = "Best regards,\\nThe Customer Success Team\\nAcme Corporation"

// Use in email tool
"{{ snippets.email_greeting }}

[Personalized response goes here]

{{ snippets.email_signature }}"

```
