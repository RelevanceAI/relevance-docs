## Getting Started

1. Select the knowledge set you would like to use.
2. Filter condition: “and” vs “or” when matching data to delete:
   - Use **_and_** when all specified conditions must match for a row to be deleted. 
   - Use **_or_** when any of the conditions can match.

   <Note>
     Filter condition only applies if you include more than one object in the filter
   </Note>
3. Filters: Accepts an array of objects, where each object corresponds to a row. Add more objects to delete multiple rows at once.

## Formatting Examples

### Example 1: Delete single condition

```json
// All poodles will be deleted
[
  {
    "breed": "poodle"
  }
]
```

### Example 2: Delete single condition

```json
// All small poodles will be deleted
[
  {
    "breed": "poodle",
	"size": "small"
  }
]
```

### Example 3: Delete multiple conditions (_or_)

```json
// All small poodles will be deleted AND any dog aged 4 will be deleted
[
  {
    "breed": "poodle",
    "size": "small"
  }, 
  {
    "age": 4
  }
]
```

### Example 3: Delete multiple conditions (_and_)

```json
// Only small poodles that are aged 4 will be deleted
[
  {
    "breed": "poodle",
    "size": "small"
  }, 
  {
    "age": 4
  }
]
```

<Note>
  Ensure to separate each object with a comma if inserting multiple rows.
</Note>

### **FAQs**

**1. What happens if I don’t enable “Sync on Upload”?**

If “Sync on Upload” is disabled, the data will be stored but not vectorized. This means your agents won’t be able to semantically search or reference that data until you manually vectorize it.

**2. Can I update or delete rows later?**

Yes. After inserting data, you can manage your knowledge set using the available tools this includes updating or deleting rows as needed.

**3. What data types can I insert?**

You can insert text, numbers, booleans, or any JSON-serializable value. Just make sure each object in the array follows the correct formatting.
