## Getting Started

1. Select the knowledge set you would like to use.
2. 
3. New data to insert: Accepts an array of objects, where each object corresponds to a row. Add additional objects to insert multiple rows at once.

## Formatting Examples

### Example 1: Insert single row

```json
[
  {
    "breed": "poodle",
    "size": "small"
  }
]
```

### Example 2: Insert multiple rows

```json
[
  {
    "breed": "poodle",
    "size": "small"
  }, 
  {
    "breed": "great dane",
    "size": "large"
  }
]
```

<Note>
  Ensure to separate each object with a comma if inserting multiple rows.
</Note>

### **FAQs**

**1. What happens if I don’t enable “Sync on Upload”?**

If “Sync on Upload” is disabled, the data will be stored but not vectorized. This means your agents won’t be able to semantically search or reference that data until you manually vectorize it.

**2. Can I update or delete rows later?**

Yes. After inserting data, you can manage your knowledge set using the available tools this includes updating or deleting rows as needed.

**3. What data types can I insert?**

You can insert text, numbers, booleans, or any JSON-serializable value. Just make sure each object in the array follows the correct formatting.
