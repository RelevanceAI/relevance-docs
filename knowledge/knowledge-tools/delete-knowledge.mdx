## Getting Started

1. Select the knowledge set you would like to use.
2. Filter condition: “and” vs “or” when matching data to delete:
   - Use **_and_** when all specified conditions must match for a row to be deleted. 
   - Use **_or_** when any of the conditions can match.

   <Note>
     Filter condition only applies if you include more than one object in the filter
   </Note>
3. Filters: Accepts an array of objects, where each object corresponds to a row. Add more objects to delete multiple rows at once.

## Formatting Examples

### Example 1: Delete single condition

```json
// All poodles will be deleted
[
  {
    "breed": "poodle"
  }
]
```

### Example 2: Delete single condition

```json
// All small poodles will be deleted
[
  {
    "breed": "poodle",
	"size": "small"
  }
]
```

### Example 3: Delete multiple conditions (_or_)

```json
// All small poodles will be deleted AND any dog aged 4 will be deleted
[
  {
    "breed": "poodle",
    "size": "small"
  }, 
  {
    "age": 4
  }
]
```

### Example 3: Delete multiple conditions (_and_)

```json
// Only small poodles that are aged 4 will be deleted
[
  {
    "breed": "poodle",
    "size": "small"
  }, 
  {
    "age": 4
  }
]
```

<Note>
  Ensure to separate each object with a comma if inserting multiple rows.
</Note>

### **FAQs**

**1. What’s the difference between using “AND” and “OR”?**

- Use **AND** when _all_ filter conditions must be true for a row to be deleted.
- Use **OR** when _any_ one of the conditions can match.

  This only applies when you include more than one object in the filter array.

**2. Can I delete multiple rows at once?**

Yes. Any row that matches the filter condition you have specified will be deleted.

**3. What if my filters don’t match any rows?**

If no rows match the provided conditions, no data will be deleted. Make sure your filter values exactly match the data in the knowledge set (e.g., casing, field names, etc.).
