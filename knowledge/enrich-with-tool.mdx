<Tip>
When setting up an enrichment, try it on the first few [rows](/tool/single-run) first to confirm the output 
and behavior is as expected. Then apply the analysis to your whole table.
</Tip>
Enriching with tools allows you to update your knowledge base using AI tools.

Select the knowledge table you want to enrich, click on `Enrich with Tool` and choose the tool your want to use from the library.

Configure how the tool should process and add information to your table by mapping outputs to columns, then run the enrichment.
