## Overview

While integrations enhance your AI agents' capabilities by connecting them to external services, there may be times when you need to remove these connections. Whether you're switching service providers, or simply cleaning up unused connections, Relevance AI provides a straightforward process for removing integrations.

## How to Remove Integrations

Follow these steps to remove an integration from your Relevance AI account:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** page from the left-hand menu of your Relevance AI account.
2. Locate the integration you want to remove in your list of connected services.
3. Click on the integration to expand its details.
4. Click the three dots settings button and click the **Remove** button.

Once disconnected, the integration will no longer appear in your list of available connections, and your AI agents will no longer have access to that service.

## Important Considerations

Before removing an integration, consider the following:

### Impact on Agents

* **Check Dependencies**: Verify which agents are currently using the integration before removing it.
* **Update Agent Workflows**: Agents that rely on the removed integration may need reconfiguration to prevent workflow disruptions.
* **Tool Availability**: Tools that depend on the removed integration will no longer function properly.

## Reconnecting Integrations

If you need to reconnect an integration after removing it:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** page.
2. Browse the available integrations and select the service you want to reconnect.
3. Follow the authentication steps to reauthorize the connection.
4. Once reconnected, the integration will appear in your list of available connections.

## FAQs

**Q: How do I know which agents are using a particular integration?**  
A: Before removing an integration, go to each agent's settings and check the "Connected Resources" or "Tools" section to see which integrations they're using.
