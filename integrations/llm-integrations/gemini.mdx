## Accessing Gemini models using Google AI Studio

If you use Google AI Studio, you can add your API key to Relevance AI, which will allow you to use your Google AI Studio credits as opposed to your Relevance AI credits. 

You can add your Google AI Studio API key to Relevance AI by following these steps:
1. Generate your API key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/welcome)
2. Log into Relevance AI and head to 'Integrations & App Keys'
3. Search for 'Google AI Studio Gemini API Key' and add your API key

Once you've successfully added your API key, you will not be charged Relevance AI credits when you use Google Gemini models in your LLM Tool steps and Agents. 

## Accessing Gemini models using Vertex AI on Google Cloud Platform

If you use Google Cloud Platform, you can connect your Vertex AI API key to Relevance AI, which will allow you to use your Google Cloud Platform credits as opposed to your Relevance AI credits. 

You can do this by following these steps:

<Steps>
