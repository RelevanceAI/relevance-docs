## Triggering Agents from Slack

![Slack Triggers New Pn](/images/slack_triggers_new.png)

You can trigger your Agents directly from Slack. This will start your Agent in Relevance AI based on a keyword of your choice, and then will reply to your message in Slack.

To get started, first **invite Relevance AI to the Slack channel you want to trigger Agents from** by typing `/invite @Relevance AI` into the channel.

Then, set up your Trigger from Relevance AI.

</div>

1. Enter your Triggers page in your Agent, and create a new Trigger
2. Select Slack
3. Connect or select your Slack account, then click 'Continue'
4. Select the channel you want your Agent to be triggered on
5. Enter the keyword you want the Agent to be triggered on - if you want the Agent to be triggered on all messages that tag `@Relevance AI`, leave this blank
6. Click 'Continue'
7. Queue work hours if needed
8. Click 'Setup trigger'

Once you've done this, you can trigger your Agent from Slack by tagging `@Relevance AI` and mentioning the keyword you've set (if you set a keyword)\!

## Making API calls with Slack using Tool steps

You can configure your Slack agent to make API calls to Slack via Relevance AI's tool builder. This allows you to perform actions such as posting Slack messages to channels, or reading messages from channels. These are just a few examples of the many Slack actions available. Your agents can combine these actions with their reasoning capabilities to create sophisticated workflows that enhance team communication and productivity.

<Tip>
  Type in "Slack" in the search bar to see all the available Slack actions.

Relevance AI enables users to access verified and genuine generative models from secure and trusted vendors. However, generative AI technologies still leave the potential for hallucinations leading to potentially inaccurate responses. Please review and verify the agent's output and use a combination of deterministic and agentic behaviour to achieve the most reliable results.
