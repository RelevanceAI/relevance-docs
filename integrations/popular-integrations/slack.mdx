## Triggering Agents or Workforces from Slack

![Slack Triggers New Pn](/images/slack_triggers_new.png)

You can trigger your Agents or Workforces directly from Slack channels or your own DM. This will start your Agent or Workforce in Relevance AI based on a keyword of your choice, and then will reply to your message in Slack.

### Setting up triggers for channels

To trigger from a **channel**, first **invite Relevance AI to the Slack channel** by typing `/invite @Relevance AI` into the channel.

### Setting up triggers for DMs

To trigger from your **own DM**, open a DM with the Relevance AI bot in Slack and **send it any message**. This establishes the DM connection and makes your DM appear in the channel selection dropdown.

<Tip>
  **Channel vs DM setup:**
  
  1. **For channels:** Use `/invite @Relevance AI` in the channel
  2. **For your DM:** Send a message to the Relevance AI bot (any message works)
</Tip>

Then, set up your Trigger from Relevance AI by following the steps below:

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cme12y0di08sig56jgsky0owk" frameBorder="0" title="How to set up the Slack trigger" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />

</div>

1. **To trigger your Agent:** enter your Triggers page in your Agent, and create a new Trigger. **To trigger your Workforce:** enter your Workforce page, select a Trigger.

2. Select Slack.
3. Connect or select your Slack account, then click 'Continue'.
4. Select the channel or DM you want your Agent to be triggered on.
5. Enter the keyword you want the Agent to be triggered on - if you want the Agent to be triggered on all messages that tag `@Relevance AI`, leave this blank.
6. Click 'Continue'.
7. Queue work hours if needed.
8. Click 'Setup trigger'.

<Note>
Once setup, you can trigger your Agent from Slack by tagging `@Relevance AI` and mentioning the keyword you've set (if you set a keyword)! You can also keep the conversation rolling in threads - simply `@Relevance AI` in thread for your agent to respond, with full context of the conversation. If you don't want your Agent  to respond to any messages, simply turn off Agent replies in the advanced settings of the trigger setup.
</Note>

### Customised Message Formatting
When using the Send Message (advanced) tool step, you can send messages through Slack with enhanced formatting. This includes:
1. **Emojis:** Add emojis to make your messages more engaging and expressive.
2. **Bolded text:** Use bold formatting to highlight important information.
3. **Images:** Include images to provide visual context or instructions.

</div>

Once connected, your integration for Slack will be available for use with your Agents and Tools.

## Making API calls with Slack using Tool steps

You can configure your Slack agent to make API calls to Slack via Relevance AI's tool builder. This allows you to perform actions such as posting Slack messages to channels, or reading messages from channels. These are just a few examples of the many Slack actions available. Your agents can combine these actions with their reasoning capabilities to create sophisticated workflows that enhance team communication and productivity.

<Tip>
  Type in "Slack" in the search bar to see all the available Slack actions.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use my own Slack DM as a trigger?">
    Yes! You can use your own Slack DM as a trigger source. Here's how to set it up:
    
    1. Open a DM with the Relevance AI bot in Slack
    2. Send the bot any message (this establishes the DM connection)
    3. Your DM will then appear in the channel selection dropdown when setting up triggers in Relevance AI
    
    **Note:** For DMs, you don't use the `/invite` command. Simply sending a message to the bot is enough to establish the connection. If your DM doesn't appear in the channel list, make sure you've sent at least one message to the Relevance AI bot first.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I send specific messages to someone on Slack?">
    If you want to be able to send a message to a specific person in Slack, that person will first need to send a message to the Relevance AI bot in Slack. Once they do this, their name will appear as a destination option when sending Slack messages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Slack isn't working as intended, how do I fix it?">
    The most common reason Slack isn't working as expected is that your integration needs to be updated. We occasionally release improvements to our Slack app, and older installations don't pick these up automatically. Updating only takes a moment - go to your project's integrations page, find your Slack connection and click 'Reconnect'.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When I setup a Slack trigger, I can't find channels in my workspace.">
    This usually happens for one of two reasons. First, the email address you use in Slack may not match the email you used when signing up to Relevance - we require these to be the same. Second, the Relevance AI app might not have been invited to the channel yet. To fix this, open the channel and run `/invite @RelevanceAI`, and it should appear.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the easiest way to install the Relevance AI Slack App?">
    The easiest and most reliable method is to install Slack directly through Relevance. Start the Slack integration connection flow in Relevance and a request will automatically be sent to your Slack admin for approval. In some cases, admins install the Relevance AI app in Slack before the integration is set up in Relevance, which can create sync issues. Installing via Relevance avoids this.

Relevance AI enables users to access verified and genuine generative models from secure and trusted vendors.
