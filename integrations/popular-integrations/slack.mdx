## Making API Calls With Slack Using Tool Steps

You can configure your Slack agent to make API calls to Slack via Relevance AI's tool builder. This allows you to perform actions such as posting Slack messages to channels, or reading messages from channels. These are just a few examples of the many Slack actions available. Your agents can combine these actions with their reasoning capabilities to create sophisticated workflows that enhance team communication and productivity.

<Tip>
  Type in "Slack" in the search bar to see all the available Slack actions.
