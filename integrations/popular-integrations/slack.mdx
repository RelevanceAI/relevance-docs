## Tools & Tool Steps

Slack integration provides a variety of powerful actions that your agents can use to interact with your Slack workspace. These actions can be incorporated into your agent's workflow to automate communication and information sharing.

### Common Slack actions available:

1. Send Message to Channel: Post messages to specific Slack channels.
   - Channel: #general
   - Message: "The weekly report is now available. You can view it here: [link]"
2. Send Direct Message: Send private messages to specific Slack users.
   - User: @johndoe
   - Message: "Your requested analysis is complete. Here are the results..."
3. Create a Thread Reply: Respond to existing messages in a thread.
   - Channel: #support
   - Thread TS: "1647359102.003200"
   - Message: "I've looked into this issue and found a solution..."
4. Upload File: Share files directly to Slack channels.
   - Channel: #reports
   - File: quarterly_results.pdf
   - Comment: "Here's the quarterly financial report"
5. React to Message: Add emoji reactions to messages.
   - Channel: #ideas
   - Message TS: "1647359102.003200"
   - Reaction: "thumbsup"
6. Create Slack Poll: Generate interactive polls in channels.
   - Channel: #team
   - Question: "When should we schedule the next team meeting?"
   - Options: ["Monday 2pm", "Tuesday 10am", "Wednesday 3pm"]
7. Get Channel History: Retrieve recent messages from a channel.
   - Channel: #project-alpha
   - Count: 10
8. Search Messages: Find specific messages across channels.
   - Query: "budget approval"

These are just a few examples of the many Slack actions available. Your agents can combine these actions with their reasoning capabilities to create sophisticated workflows that enhance team communication and productivity.

## Use the integration's API tool step (advanced)

In addition to the pre-built actions available in the tool directory, you can build custom tools that perform Slack-specific activities using the Slack API Call tool step:

1. Create a new tool in the Tool Builder.
2. Scroll down to Tool-steps.
3. Add "Slack API" tool-step.
4. Select your connected Slack account in the dropdown.
5. Configure the API endpoint and parameters based on your specific needs.

This advanced approach allows you to access the full range of Slack API capabilities, enabling custom integrations tailored to your organization's unique requirements.

### Example: Custom Slack API call to create a channel
```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "endpoint": "conversations.create",
  "params": {
    "name": "project-{{project_name}}",
    "is_private": false
  }
}
```

### Example: Custom Slack API call to invite users to a channel

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "endpoint": "conversations.invite",
  "params": {
    "channel": "{{channel_id}}",
    "users": "{{user_ids}}"
  }
}
```

## Remove Slack integration

If you need to remove the Slack integration:

1. Go to the "Integrations" page from the sidebar.
2. Select Slack from the list.
3. Click "..." on the account you want to remove.
4. Click "Remove" and confirm your choice.

This will disconnect your Slack workspace from Relevance AI, and your agents will no longer be able to interact with Slack until you reconnect the integration.
