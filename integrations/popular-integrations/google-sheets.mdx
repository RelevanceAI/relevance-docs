## Setting Up Triggers with Google Sheets *(coming soon)*

The Google Sheets integration can be configured to trigger your AI agents based on specific spreadsheet events or conditions:

### Trigger Types

- **New Row Added**: Activate your agent when a new row is added to a specified sheet
- **Cell Value Changed**: Trigger your agent when values in specific cells or columns are modified
- **Threshold Reached**: Start your agent when a numeric value in your sheet crosses a defined threshold
- **Scheduled Updates**: Configure your agent to process sheet data at regular intervals

### Setting Up a Trigger 

1. Navigate to your agent's profile
2. Select "Google Sheets" from the trigger options
3. Choose the specific Google Sheet you want to monitor
4. Select the trigger type (e.g., New Row Added)
5. Configure any additional parameters specific to your chosen trigger
6. Save your trigger configuration

Your agent will now automatically activate when the specified condition is met in your Google Sheets document.

## Tools & Tool Steps

The Google Sheets integration provides a variety of powerful actions that your agents can perform. These actions can be incorporated into your agent's workflow as tool steps, allowing for seamless interaction with your spreadsheet data.

### Available Actions

- **Read Sheet Data**: Extract data from specific sheets, ranges, or cells
- **Write to Sheet**: Add or update data in your spreadsheets
- **Create New Sheet**: Generate new spreadsheets with specified data
- **Format Cells**: Apply formatting to cells based on conditions or data analysis
- **Create Charts**: Generate visual representations of your data
- **Apply Formulas**: Insert Google Sheets formulas based on AI analysis
- **Filter Data**: Extract specific information based on custom criteria
- **Sort Data**: Organize spreadsheet information in meaningful ways
- **Append Rows**: Add new rows of data to existing sheets
- **Delete Data**: Remove specific cells, rows, or columns

These actions represent just a small sample of what's possible with the Google Sheets integration. The tool library contains many more specialized actions to help you build powerful data workflows.

### Using Google Sheets Actions in Your Workflow

1. In your agent's workflow, add a new tool step
2. Search for "Google Sheets" in the tool library
3. Browse the available actions and select the one you need
4. Configure the action parameters (sheet ID, range, data to write, etc.)
5. Connect this action to other steps in your workflow

## Using the Google Sheets API Tool Step (Advanced)

For advanced users who need custom functionality beyond the pre-built actions, you can leverage the Google Sheets API directly:

1. Create a new tool in your agent's workflow
2. Scroll down to Tool-steps
3. Add "Google Sheets API" tool-step
4. Select your connected Google Sheets account from the dropdown
5. Specify the API endpoint and parameters for your custom request
6. Configure how the response data should be processed

This approach gives you full access to the Google Sheets API capabilities, allowing for highly customized interactions with your spreadsheet data.
