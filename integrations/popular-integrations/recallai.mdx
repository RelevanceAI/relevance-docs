## Using the Send Meeting Bot Tool

The **Send Meeting Bot** tool is the primary way to use RecallAI in your agents. This tool sends a bot to join and record meetings.

### Tool Configuration

When adding the Send Meeting Bot tool to your agent:

<ParamField path="meeting_url" type="string" required>
  The video conference URL (Google Meet, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams link)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="bot_name" type="string">
  The name displayed for the bot in the meeting (default: "Notetaker Bot")
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="recording_mode" type="string">
  What to record: "audio_only", "video_only", or "audio_and_video" (default)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="transcription_enabled" type="boolean">
  Enable real-time transcription (default: true)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="speaker_identification" type="boolean">
  Enable automatic speaker identification (default: true)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="join_at" type="string">
  When to join: "immediately", "at_scheduled_time", or specific timestamp
</ParamField>

### Example Tool Usage

In your agent's tool configuration:

```json
{
  "tool": "send_meeting_bot",
  "parameters": {
    "meeting_url": "{{meeting_link}}",
    "bot_name": "Meeting Assistant",
    "recording_mode": "audio_and_video",
    "transcription_enabled": true,
    "speaker_identification": true,
    "join_at": "immediately"
  }
}
```

### Tool Output

After the meeting ends, the tool returns:

<ResponseField name="transcript" type="string">
  Full transcript of the meeting with speaker labels and timestamps
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="recording_url" type="string">
  URL to access the meeting recording (audio/video)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="duration" type="number">
  Meeting duration in seconds
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="participants" type="array">
  List of meeting participants identified during the call
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="speakers" type="array">
  List of speakers with their speaking time and segments
</ResponseField>

## Meeting Bot Behavior

### Joining Meetings

When your agent sends a meeting bot:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Bot Enters Meeting">
    The bot joins as a visible participant with the configured name
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Announcement (Optional)">
    Configure the bot to announce itself: "Hi, I'm Meeting Assistant, here to record and transcribe this meeting"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Recording Starts">
    Recording and transcription begin immediately upon joining
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Continuous Monitoring">
    Bot remains in the meeting until it ends or is manually removed
  </Step>
</Steps>

### During the Meeting

The meeting bot:

- **Appears as a participant** in the participant list
- **Records audio/video** based on your configuration
- **Transcribes in real-time** with speaker identification
- **Responds to commands** if Interaction Webhooks are enabled
- **Handles interruptions** gracefully (network issues, platform changes)

### After the Meeting

Once the meeting ends:

- **Processing begins** immediately
- **Transcript is generated** with full speaker attribution
- **Recording is uploaded** to secure storage
- **Data is returned** to your agent for further processing

## Platform-Specific Considerations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Google Meet">
    **Requirements:**
    - Meeting must be started before bot can join
    - No special permissions required
    - Bot appears as regular participant
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Have host start meeting before bot joins
    - Ensure meeting link is valid and accessible
    - Bot name should be descriptive
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Zoom">
    **Requirements:**
    - Host must enable recording permissions
    - Bot needs to be admitted from waiting room (if enabled)
    - Account settings may restrict bot access
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Coordinate with meeting host beforehand
    - Disable waiting room for bot meetings
    - Configure Zoom settings to allow recording
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Microsoft Teams">
    **Requirements:**
    - Works with enterprise Teams accounts
    - May require admin approval for bot access
    - Recording permissions must be enabled
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Verify Teams recording policies
    - Ensure bot has necessary permissions
    - Test with internal meetings first
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
