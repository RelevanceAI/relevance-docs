## Use the integration's API tool step (Advanced)

In addition to the pre-built actions available in the tool directory, you can build custom tools that perform Outlook-specific activities using the Microsoft Outlook API Call tool step. This gives you access to the full Microsoft Graph API for advanced email, calendar, and contact operations.

### How to use the Microsoft Outlook API Call tool step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new tool">
    Create a new tool in Relevance AI or open an existing tool you want to add Outlook functionality to.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add the Microsoft Outlook API Call tool step">
    1. Scroll down to Tool-steps
    2. Search for "Microsoft Outlook API Call" in the tool step search bar
    3. Add the Microsoft Outlook API Call tool step to your workflow
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select your Outlook account">
    Select your connected Outlook account from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure the API endpoint">
    Configure the API endpoint, method, and parameters according to your needs:
    - **Method**: Select the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
    - **Endpoint**: Enter the API endpoint path (e.g., `/me/messages`, `/me/calendar/events`)
    - **Body**: Add any required request body data
    - **Headers**: Add any custom headers if needed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test your API call">
    Test your configuration to ensure it works correctly before deploying.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Creating a Calendar Event with Custom Properties

Here's a practical example of using the Microsoft Outlook API Call tool step to create a calendar event with custom properties:

**API Endpoint**: `POST /me/calendar/events`

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "endpoint": "/me/calendar/events",
  "body": {
    "subject": "Team Sync Meeting",
    "body": {
      "contentType": "HTML",
      "content": "Discuss Q4 objectives and team priorities"
    },
    "start": {
      "dateTime": "2024-12-01T14:00:00",
      "timeZone": "Pacific Standard Time"
    },
    "end": {
      "dateTime": "2024-12-01T15:00:00",
      "timeZone": "Pacific Standard Time"
    },
    "location": {
      "displayName": "Conference Room A"
    },
    "attendees": [
      {
        "emailAddress": {
          "address": "colleague@example.com",
          "name": "Colleague Name"
        },
        "type": "required"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This configuration:
- Uses the POST method to create a new event
- Specifies the event details including subject, body, and location
- Sets the start and end times with timezone information
- Adds attendees to the meeting

## Set up Outlook as a trigger

You can configure your agents to automatically respond to incoming Outlook emails by setting up Outlook as a trigger.

### How to set up the Outlook trigger

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open agent settings">
    Navigate to your agent's settings page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Outlook trigger">
    1. Click on "Integrations" in the sidebar
    2. Under "Triggers", click on the Outlook button
    3. Select your connected Outlook account
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure email filters (optional)">
    Choose whether to filter emails that trigger your agent. Without a search filter, your agent will receive every email sent to your connected account.
    
    You can use Microsoft Graph search query syntax to filter emails:
    - `subject:ask us anything` - Subject contains "ask us anything"
    - `body:book a demo` - Body contains "book a demo"
    - `from:*apple.com` - Only emails from apple.com domain
    - `hasAttachments:true` - Only emails with attachments
    - `received:07/23/2018` - Only emails received on this date
    
    [View full search syntax documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/search-query-parameter)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a response tool">
    Build a tool that uses the "Send Email (Outlook)" tool step to respond to emails. Equip your agent with this tool in the agent settings.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure tool permissions">
    Set the tool permissions to "approval mode" initially so your agent asks for permission before sending emails. Switch to autopilot once you're confident in the responses.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Write agent instructions">
    In the "Core Instructions" section of your agent settings, write a prompt that guides your agent on how to respond to emails.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  It can take up to 30 minutes for the first email to come through after setting up the trigger.
</Note>

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I converted my account input to an input variable but can't see my account. What should I do?">
    This issue occurs because new Microsoft Teams scopes have been added to the Outlook integration (`OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All` and `MailBoxSettings.Read`). 
    
    **Solution**: Update the permission type filter to select the **Microsoft Teams** option. This will allow you to see and select your Outlook account that now includes the expanded Microsoft Teams permissions.
    
    If you continue to experience issues, try reconnecting your Outlook account through the Integrations page to ensure all the latest permissions are granted.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What permissions does the Outlook integration require?">
    The integration requires permissions to read and write emails, manage calendar events, access contacts, and read mailbox settings. This includes Microsoft Teams scopes for meeting transcripts and mailbox settings. You can review the specific permissions during the authentication process.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does it take for the email trigger to start working?">
    After setting up the Outlook trigger, it can take up to 30 minutes for the first email to come through to your agent. Subsequent emails should be processed more quickly, typically within a few minutes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I filter which emails trigger my agent?">
    Yes! You can use Microsoft Graph search query syntax to filter emails. For example:
    - Filter by subject: `subject:customer inquiry`
    - Filter by sender: `from:*company.com`
    - Filter by attachments: `hasAttachments:true`
    - Combine filters: `subject:urgent AND from:*vip.com`
    
    [View full search syntax documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/search-query-parameter)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use multiple Outlook accounts with my agents?">
    Yes, you can connect multiple Outlook accounts through the Integrations page. When building tools or setting up triggers, you can select which account to use from the dropdown menu. This is useful for managing different email addresses or separating personal and business communications.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I prevent my agent from sending emails automatically?">
    Set your email-sending tools to "approval mode" in the agent settings. This ensures your agent will always ask for permission before sending an email. You can review the draft, make edits if needed, and then approve or reject the send action.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can my agent access shared mailboxes or distribution lists?">
    Yes, if you have the appropriate permissions, your agent can access shared mailboxes. You'll need to use the Microsoft Graph API Call tool step with endpoints like `/users/{userId}/messages` instead of `/me/messages`. Make sure your connected account has delegated access to the shared mailbox.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between the pre-built Outlook tool steps and the API Call tool step?">
    Pre-built tool steps (like "Send Email" or "Create Event") are designed for specific, common tasks and have simplified interfaces with guided inputs. The Microsoft Outlook API Call tool step gives you full access to Microsoft Graph API, allowing you to implement any functionality available in the API, including advanced operations not covered by pre-built steps.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are there rate limits for Outlook API calls?">
    Yes, Microsoft Graph API enforces rate limits. The specific limits depend on your Microsoft 365 subscription and the type of requests being made. Your agents should be designed to handle rate limiting gracefully. Microsoft typically returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status code when limits are exceeded.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I access email attachments with the Outlook integration?">
    Yes, you can access email attachments using the Microsoft Graph API. Use the endpoint `GET /me/messages/{id}/attachments` to list attachments, and `GET /me/messages/{id}/attachments/{attachmentId}` to download specific attachments. The attachment content is returned as base64-encoded data.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I remove the Outlook integration?">
    To remove the Outlook integration:
    1. Open your agent settings
    2. Navigate to "Integrations"
    3. Click the three dots menu next to your connected Outlook trigger
    4. Click "Remove"
    
    Once removed, your agent will no longer receive emails or have access to your Outlook data. You can also disconnect the integration entirely from the main Integrations page.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use the Outlook integration with Office 365 or Microsoft 365?">
    Yes! The Outlook integration works with Outlook.com, Office 365, and Microsoft 365 accounts. All these services use the same Microsoft Graph API, so the integration functions identically across all Microsoft email platforms.
  </Accordion>
