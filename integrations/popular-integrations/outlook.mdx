## Overview

Connect your Microsoft Outlook account to Relevance AI and supercharge your email workflow with AI agents that can read, respond to, and take action on your emails, manage your calendar, and organize your contacts. The Outlook integration enables you to automate email-related tasks, schedule meetings, manage contacts, create powerful workflows, and save valuable time.

## Connect the integration

Setting up the Outlook integration with Relevance AI is straightforward:

1. Go to the "Integrations" page in the sidebar of your Relevance AI dashboard.
2. Click on "Outlook" from the available integrations.
3. Click the "Add Integration" button.
4. In the pop-up window, sign into your Microsoft account and authorize Relevance AI to access your Outlook data.
5. Follow any additional prompts to complete the connection process.
6. Once connected, you'll see your Outlook account listed under connected integrations.

## Setting up triggers

The Outlook integration allows you to set up triggers that automatically activate your AI agents when specific email events occur. This enables your agents to respond to emails in real-time without manual intervention.

To set up Outlook as a trigger:

1. Create or edit an agent in Relevance AI.
2. Navigate to the "Triggers" section in "Agent Profile".
3. Select "Outlook" as the trigger source.
4. Configure the trigger conditions based on your needs using search filters.

### Filter options

If you don't add a search filter, your agent will receive every email that is sent to the connected Outlook account, which might be what you want if your agent has a dedicated email account.

Below are different search filters you can use, which is also how you filter emails in your Outlook search field. Full documentation can be found in Microsoft's [Search Query Parameter page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/search-query-parameter?tabs=http):

- **`subject: ask us anything`** - The subject line contains the phrase "ask us anything"
- **`body: book a demo`** - The body of the email contains the phrase "book a demo"
- **`from:*apple.com`** - Only emails sent from the apple.com domain
- **`hasAttachments: true`** - Only emails that have attachments
- **`received: 07/23/2018`** - Only emails received on this date

Once set up, your agent will automatically start working whenever the specified email conditions are met, allowing for seamless email automation.

## Tools & Tool Steps

The Outlook integration provides a comprehensive set of actions that your AI agents can use to interact with your email account, calendar, and contacts. These actions can be incorporated into your agent's workflow to perform various tasks.

### Advanced

For more complex use cases:

- **Microsoft Outlook API call**: Make direct API calls to access advanced Outlook features not covered by standard tools

These are just some examples of the many actions available. The Outlook integration is highly versatile, allowing your agents to perform virtually any task you would normally do manually in your Outlook account.

## Use the integration's API tool step (advanced)

For more advanced use cases, you can leverage the Microsoft Graph API directly using the Microsoft Outlook API Call tool step:

1. Create a new tool in Relevance AI.
2. Scroll down to Tool-steps.
3. Add the Microsoft Outlook API tool-step.
4. Select your connected Outlook account in the dropdown.

With the Outlook API tool step, you can:

1. **Access Advanced Outlook Features**: Utilize Microsoft Graph API endpoints not covered by standard actions
2. **Custom Email Processing**: Create specialized workflows for unique email handling requirements
3. **Batch Operations**: Perform actions on multiple emails, events, or contacts simultaneously
4. **Complex Filtering**: Implement sophisticated filtering logic across emails, calendar, and contacts
5. **Integration with Other Microsoft Services**: Connect your workflows with Teams, OneDrive, and other Microsoft 365 services

### Example: Custom Email Processing with Outlook API

Here's an example of using the Outlook API tool step to implement a custom email processing workflow:

```json
// Example of using Microsoft Graph API to process emails with specific criteria
{
  "method": "GET",
  "endpoint": "me/messages",
  "params": {
    "$filter": "isRead eq false and from/emailAddress/address eq 'important-client@example.com'",
    "$top": 10,
    "$orderby": "receivedDateTime DESC"
  }
}
```

This API call retrieves up to 10 unread emails from a specific sender, ordered by most recent first, which your agent can then process according to your business rules.
