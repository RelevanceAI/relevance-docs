Microsoft Outlook is one of the world's leading email and productivity platforms. With Relevance AI's Outlook integration, you can seamlessly connect your Outlook account to your AI agents, enabling them to manage emails, schedule meetings, organize contacts, and automate workflows, making your communication and productivity processes more efficient and intelligent.

<Warning>
  The Outlook integration in Relevance AI was built by Relevance AI, and is therefore supported by our team, not Microsoft. If you have a question or issue with using Outlook in Relevance AI, please [reach out to our support team](/get-started/support). If you have a question or issue that is only about Outlook, you can [reach out to Microsoft support](https://support.microsoft.com/).
</Warning>

Connecting your Outlook account to Relevance AI is a straightforward process:

1. Go to the "Integrations" page in the sidebar of your Relevance AI dashboard.
2. Click on "Outlook" from the available integrations.
3. Click on the "Add Integration" button.
4. In the pop-up window, sign into your Microsoft account.
5. Grant the necessary permissions for Relevance AI to access your Outlook data (email, calendar, contacts).
6. Once authenticated, your Outlook account will appear as a connected integration.

<Tip>
  Type "Outlook" in the tool step search bar to see all available Outlook actions when building your tools.
</Tip>

## Use the integration's API tool step (Advanced)

In addition to the pre-built actions available in the tool directory, you can build custom tools that perform Outlook-specific activities using the Microsoft Outlook API Call tool step.

### How to use the Outlook API Call tool step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new tool">
    Create a new tool in Relevance AI or open an existing tool you want to add Outlook functionality to.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add the Microsoft Outlook API Call tool step">
    1. Scroll down to Tool-steps
    2. Search for "Microsoft Outlook API Call" in the tool step search bar
    3. Add the Microsoft Outlook API Call tool step to your workflow
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select your Outlook account">
    Select your connected Outlook account from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure the API endpoint">
    Configure the API endpoint, method, and parameters according to your needs:
    - **Method**: Select the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
    - **Endpoint**: Enter the API endpoint path (e.g., `/me/messages`, `/me/calendar/events`)
    - **Body**: Add any required request body data
    - **Query Parameters**: Add filters, sorting, or pagination parameters
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test your API call">
    Test your configuration to ensure it works correctly before deploying.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Processing Unread Emails from Important Contacts

Here's a practical example of using the Outlook API Call tool step to retrieve and process unread emails from specific senders:

**API Endpoint**: `GET /me/messages`

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "endpoint": "/me/messages",
  "params": {
    "$filter": "isRead eq false and from/emailAddress/address eq 'important-client@example.com'",
    "$top": 10,
    "$orderby": "receivedDateTime DESC",
    "$select": "subject,from,receivedDateTime,bodyPreview"
  }
}
```

This configuration:
- Uses the GET method to retrieve messages
- Filters for unread emails from a specific sender
- Limits results to the 10 most recent emails
- Orders by received date (newest first)
- Selects only the fields you need to reduce response size

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I converted my account input to an input variable but can't see my account. What should I do?">
    When using Microsoft Outlook tools (like "send outlook email"), if you convert the account input to an input variable and cannot see your connected account in the dropdown, you need to update the permission type filter:

    1. Go to input settings
    2. Click the permission type filter
    3. Select the **Microsoft Teams** option

    This is necessary because new scopes were added (`OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All` and `MailBoxSettings.Read`) that require the Microsoft Teams permission type to be selected.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What permissions does Relevance AI need for the Outlook integration?">
    The integration requires permissions to read, send, and manage your emails, access your calendar, and manage your contacts to provide full functionality. This includes scopes for:
    
    - Email management (read, send, organize)
    - Calendar access (read, create, update events)
    - Contact management (read, create, update)
    - Online meeting transcripts (for Teams integration)
    - Mailbox settings
    
    You can review the specific permissions during the authentication process.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use multiple Outlook accounts with Relevance AI?">
    Yes, you can connect multiple Outlook accounts to Relevance AI and configure different agents or tools to work with specific accounts. Simply add each account through the Integrations page and select the appropriate account when configuring your tool steps.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is my email data secure?">
    Yes, Relevance AI maintains strict security protocols. Your email data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and is only accessed as needed for the functions you authorize. All communications with Microsoft services use secure, encrypted connections. We follow industry best practices for data protection and compliance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I troubleshoot connection issues?">
    If you're experiencing connection issues:
    
    1. Verify your Outlook account is properly connected in the Integrations page
    2. Check that you've granted all necessary permissions during authentication
    3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your account
    4. Ensure your Microsoft account credentials are up to date
    5. Check if your organization has any restrictions on third-party app access
    
    If issues persist, contact our support team with details about the error messages you're seeing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I restrict my agent to only access certain emails or folders?">
    Yes, you can configure your tools to only interact with specific folders, senders, or email criteria using filters in the Microsoft Graph API. Use the `$filter` parameter to limit which emails your agent can access based on folder, sender, subject, date, or other properties.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Will my agent's actions appear in my Outlook account?">
    Yes, all actions performed by your agent (such as sending emails, creating calendar events, or adding contacts) will appear in your Outlook account as if you performed them yourself. Sent emails will be in your Sent folder, calendar events will appear on your calendar, etc.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are there rate limits for Outlook API calls?">
    Yes, Microsoft Graph API enforces rate limits on API calls. The specific limits depend on your Microsoft 365 subscription and the type of requests being made. Your agents should be designed to handle rate limiting gracefully. For most scenarios, the limits are generous enough for typical automation needs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use this integration with Microsoft 365 Business accounts?">
    Yes, the Outlook integration works with both personal Microsoft accounts and Microsoft 365 Business/Enterprise accounts. However, some features may require specific Microsoft 365 licenses or administrator permissions in your organization.
