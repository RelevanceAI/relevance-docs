## Overview

The Freshdesk integration allows you to connect your Freshdesk account with Relevance AI, enabling your AI agents to interact with your customer support platform. This powerful connection transforms how you handle support tickets by automating responses, categorizing issues, and providing intelligent assistance to both customers and support teams.

With this integration, you can build AI agents that monitor your Freshdesk tickets, respond to common inquiries automatically, escalate complex issues to human agents, and maintain a seamless support experience across your organization.
