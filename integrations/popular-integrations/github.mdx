GitHub is the world's leading platform for version control and collaborative software development. With Relevance AI's GitHub integration, you can seamlessly connect your GitHub repositories to your AI agents, enabling them to manage code, issues, pull requests, and workflows, making your development processes more efficient and intelligent.

<Warning>
  The GitHub integration in Relevance AI was built by Relevance AI, and is therefore supported by our team, not GitHub. If you have a question or issue with using GitHub in Relevance AI, please [reach out to our support team](/get-started/support). If you have a question or issue that is only about GitHub, you can [reach out to GitHub support](https://support.github.com/).
</Warning>

## Connect the integration

Connecting your GitHub account to Relevance AI is a straightforward process:

1. Go to the "Integrations" page in the sidebar of your Relevance AI dashboard.
2. Click on "GitHub" from the available integrations.
3. Click on the "Add Integration" button.
4. In the pop-up window, sign into your GitHub account.
5. Grant the necessary permissions for Relevance AI to access your GitHub repositories.
6. Once authenticated, your GitHub account will appear as a connected integration.

## Tool steps for GitHub

The GitHub integration provides a comprehensive set of actions that your agents can use to interact with your repositories and development workflows. These actions can be incorporated into your agent's workflows as tool steps, enabling sophisticated development automation capabilities.

<Tip>
  Type "GitHub" in the tool step search bar to see all available GitHub actions when building your tools.
</Tip>

## Use the integration's API tool step (Advanced)

In addition to the pre-built actions available in the tool directory, you can build custom tools that perform GitHub-specific activities using the GitHub API Call tool step.

<Warning>
  **Required Header:** When using the GitHub API Call tool step, you must include the header `accept: application/vnd.github+json` or you may encounter errors like `'Please enter a value for 'response_body' field'`.
</Warning>

### How to use the GitHub API Call tool step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new tool">
    Create a new tool in Relevance AI or open an existing tool you want to add GitHub functionality to.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add the GitHub API Call tool step">
    1. Scroll down to Tool-steps
    2. Search for "GitHub API Call" in the tool step search bar
    3. Add the GitHub API Call tool step to your workflow
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select your GitHub account">
    Select your connected GitHub account from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure the API endpoint">
    Configure the API endpoint, method, and parameters according to your needs:
    - **Method**: Select the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
    - **Endpoint**: Enter the API endpoint path (e.g., `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/collaborators/{username}`)
    - **Body**: Add any required request body data
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add the required header">
    **This is the critical step!** In the Headers section, add:
    
    ```json
    {
      "accept": "application/vnd.github+json"
    }
    ```
    
    <Note>
      This header tells GitHub's API what format to return the response in. Without it, the API may not return a properly formatted response, causing errors in your tool.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test your API call">
    Test your configuration to ensure it works correctly before deploying.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Managing Repository Collaborators

Here's a practical example of using the GitHub API Call tool step to add a collaborator to a repository:

**API Endpoint**: `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/collaborators/{username}`

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "method": "PUT",
  "endpoint": "/repos/myorg/myrepo/collaborators/johndoe",
  "headers": {
    "accept": "application/vnd.github+json"
  },
  "body": {
    "permission": "push"
  }
}
```

This configuration:
- Uses the PUT method to add or update a collaborator
- Specifies the repository owner, name, and collaborator username
- **Includes the required `accept` header**
- Sets the permission level to "push" (can also be "pull", "triage", "maintain", or "admin")

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What permissions does the GitHub integration require?">
    The integration requires permissions to read and write to repositories, manage issues and pull requests, and access workflow information. You can review the specific permissions during the authentication process. You can also configure fine-grained access tokens in GitHub to limit access to specific repositories.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why am I getting 'Please enter a value for response_body field' error?">
    This error typically occurs when the required `accept: application/vnd.github+json` header is missing from your GitHub API Call tool step. Make sure to add this header in the Headers section of your API call configuration.
    
    **Solution**: Add the following header to your API call:
    ```json
    {
      "accept": "application/vnd.github+json"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I restrict my Agent to only access certain repositories?">
    Yes, you can configure your tools and triggers to only interact with specific repositories by setting the appropriate repository parameters. Additionally, you can use GitHub's fine-grained personal access tokens to limit access at the GitHub level.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I authenticate with GitHub for API calls?">
    When you connect your GitHub account through the Integrations page, Relevance AI handles authentication automatically. When using the GitHub API Call tool step, simply select your connected GitHub account from the dropdown, and authentication will be handled for you.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between the pre-built GitHub tool steps and the API Call tool step?">
    Pre-built tool steps (like "Create Issue" or "Create Pull Request") are designed for specific, common tasks and have simplified interfaces with guided inputs. The GitHub API Call tool step gives you full access to GitHub's REST API, allowing you to implement any functionality available in the API, including advanced or custom operations not covered by pre-built steps.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use GitHub webhooks to trigger my agents?">
    Yes! You can set up GitHub webhooks to trigger your agents when specific events occur in your repositories (like new pull requests, issues, or commits). Configure webhooks in your GitHub repository settings to point to your agent's webhook URL in Relevance AI.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are there rate limits for GitHub API calls?">
    Yes, GitHub enforces rate limits on API calls. For authenticated requests, the limit is typically 5,000 requests per hour. Your agents should be designed to handle rate limiting gracefully. You can check your current rate limit status using the `/rate_limit` endpoint.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I work with GitHub Enterprise?">
    The GitHub integration is designed to work with GitHub.com. For GitHub Enterprise Server installations, you may need to use the generic API Tool step with custom authentication. Contact our support team for assistance with GitHub Enterprise configurations.
