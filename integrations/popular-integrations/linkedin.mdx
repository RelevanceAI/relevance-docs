Connect your LinkedIn account to Relevance AI and supercharge your networking, prospecting, and engagement capabilities with AI-powered automation. The LinkedIn Integration enables your agents to interact with LinkedIn much like a human team member would, creating a seamless bridge between your AI workforce and one of the world's most valuable professional networks.

## Connect the integration

Getting started with the LinkedIn Integration is straightforward:

1. Navigate to the "Integrations & API Keys" page in the sidebar of your Relevance AI dashboard
2. Click on "LinkedIn" from the available integrations
3. Click the "Add Integration" button
4. In the pop-up window, sign into your LinkedIn account and authorize the connection
5. Once authorized, your LinkedIn account will appear in the connected accounts list

## Setting up triggers

The LinkedIn Integration offers powerful trigger capabilities that can initiate your AI agents based on specific LinkedIn events. This allows your agents to respond automatically to important network activities.

<Warning>The LinkedIn Trigger is considered a Premium trigger, and is available on the Pro plan (new pricing) and above. If you're on the old Pro plan, you'll gain access to this trigger when you move to the new Pro plan on your first renewal on or after December 1, 2025.</Warning>

### Available LinkedIn triggers

Set up your agents to start working when:

- **All messages received** - Triggers when any message is received on LinkedIn
- **Outreach replies only** - Triggers only when replies to outreach messages are received

<Note>Connection accept notifications are only tracked if the connection request was originally sent through Relevance AI's LinkedIn integration. This is a technical limitation of the LinkedIn integration.</Note>

These triggers are available for both agents and workforces.

### How to set up a LinkedIn trigger

The setup process differs slightly depending on whether you're configuring a trigger for an agent or a workforce. Follow the instructions below based on your use case.

#### For Agents

1. Navigate to the agent builder by selecting the agent you want to configure with a LinkedIn trigger.

2. In the left sidebar of the agent builder, locate and click on the "Triggers" section.

3. Click the "Add trigger" button, then select "LinkedIn" from the available trigger types.

4. Choose the connected LinkedIn account you want to use for this trigger from the dropdown menu. If you haven't connected a LinkedIn account yet, you'll need to do so first in the Integrations & API Keys page.

5. Select the specific trigger event you want to use:
   - **All messages received** - Triggers when any message is received on LinkedIn
   - **Outreach replies only** - Triggers only when replies to outreach messages are received

6. If available on your plan, configure queue work hours to control when your agent should process LinkedIn triggers. This allows you to set specific times when your agent should be active.

#### For Workforces

1. Navigate to the workforce builder by selecting the workforce you want to configure with a LinkedIn trigger.

2. In the Build section of your workforce, locate the "Triggers" section in the node palette on the left side. Drag a trigger node onto your workspace.

3. Click on the trigger node you just added to open its configuration panel, then select "LinkedIn" as the trigger type.

4. Choose the connected LinkedIn account you want to use for this trigger from the dropdown menu. If you haven't connected a LinkedIn account yet, you'll need to do so first in the Integrations & API Keys page.

5. Select the specific trigger event you want to use:
   - **All messages received** - Triggers when any message is received on LinkedIn
   - **Outreach replies only** - Triggers only when replies to outreach messages are received

6. If available on your plan, configure queue work hours to control when your workforce should process LinkedIn triggers. This allows you to set specific times when your agents should be active.

7. Drag a connection line from the trigger node to the agent in your workforce that should respond when the trigger activates.
