### Example: Getting Deployment Details

Here's a practical example of using the Vercel API Call tool step to retrieve details about a specific deployment:

**API Endpoint**: `GET /v13/deployments/{id}`

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/v13/deployments/dpl_ABC123xyz",
  "headers": {}
}
```

This configuration:
- Uses the GET method to retrieve deployment information
- Specifies the deployment ID in the path
- Returns comprehensive details about the deployment including status, creator, and metadata

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What permissions does the Vercel integration require?">
    The integration requires permissions to manage deployments, access project information, and read deployment logs. You can review the specific permissions during the authentication process. Vercel uses OAuth for secure authentication, ensuring your credentials are never stored directly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I restrict my Agent to only access certain projects?">
    Yes, you can configure your tools and triggers to only interact with specific projects by setting the appropriate project parameters. Additionally, you can use Vercel's team-based access controls to limit which projects are accessible through the integration.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I authenticate with Vercel for API calls?">
    When you connect your Vercel account through the Integrations page, Relevance AI handles authentication automatically using OAuth. When using the Vercel API Call tool step, simply select your connected Vercel account from the dropdown, and authentication will be handled for you.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between the pre-built Vercel tool steps and the API Call tool step?">
    Pre-built tool steps (like "Create Deployment" or "List Deployments") are designed for specific, common tasks and have simplified interfaces with guided inputs. The Vercel API Call tool step gives you full access to Vercel's REST API, allowing you to implement any functionality available in the API, including advanced or custom operations not covered by pre-built steps.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use webhooks to trigger my agents based on Vercel events?">
    Yes! You can set up Vercel webhooks to trigger your agents when specific events occur in your projects (like deployment started, deployment completed, or deployment failed). Configure webhooks in your Vercel project settings to point to your agent's webhook URL in Relevance AI.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Are there rate limits for Vercel API calls?">
    Yes, Vercel enforces rate limits on API calls. The specific limits depend on your Vercel plan. Your agents should be designed to handle rate limiting gracefully. You can check your current rate limit status in the API response headers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I manage environment variables through the integration?">
    Yes! You can use the Vercel API Call tool step to create, update, and delete environment variables for your projects. This allows your agents to dynamically manage configuration across different environments.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I cancel a deployment that's already in progress?">
    Use the "Cancel Deployment" tool step or the Vercel API Call with the `PATCH /v12/deployments/{id}/cancel` endpoint. You'll need the deployment ID, which you can obtain from the "List Deployments" tool step or from deployment creation responses.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I deploy to specific branches or environments?">
    Yes! When creating a deployment, you can specify the branch, environment (production, preview, or development), and other configuration options. This allows your agents to manage multi-environment deployment strategies effectively.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
