## Overview

The MCP Server integration enables you to use your Relevance AI tools in external AI clients that support the MCP (Model Control Protocol) standard and allow your agents to run external tools available from an MCP Server connection. This powerful feature creates a seamless connection between your Relevance AI workspace and popular AI assistants like Claude and development environments like Cursor.

With MCP Server integration, you maintain a single source of truth for your tools while extending their availability across your entire AI ecosystem. This means the specialized tools you've built in Relevance AI can now be accessed and utilized by your favorite AI assistants outside our platform.

## Benefits

- **Extended tool availability**: Use your Relevance AI tools in Claude, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible AI clients
- **Centralized tool management**: Update tools in one place and have changes reflect everywhere
- **Customizable integration**: Select exactly which tools to expose to external clients
- **Simple configuration**: Generate MCP server settings with just a few clicks
- **Seamless workflow integration**: Access your specialized tools wherever you work with AI
- **External tool integration**: Allow your agents to run external tools available from an MCP Server connection

## How It Works

The MCP Server integration creates a secure bridge between your Relevance AI workspace and external AI clients. When you configure the integration, you select which tools from your workspace you want to make available to external clients. The system then generates the necessary configuration settings that you can copy into your preferred MCP-compatible client.

Once configured, your external AI assistant can access and execute the selected Relevance AI tools as if they were native to that platform. This creates a consistent experience across your entire AI workflow, regardless of which interface you're using.

## Setting Up MCP Server Integration

Setting up the MCP Server integration is straightforward:

### For Agents

Agents can connect to and run tools from remote MCP servers.

<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmg8tiu3h23ii2nomxtqolybm" frameBorder="0" title="How to set up an MCP Server connection for an agent" allow="clipboard-write" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

1. Open the Agent you want to connect
2. Head to Advanced Settings by clicking "Advanced" in the sidebar
3. Click "MCP Server"
4. Click "+ Add remote MCP tools"
5. Add the URL of the remote hosted MCP server
6. Label your MCP Server connection
7. Add any authentication details required for the MCP server

Once connected, the agent will automatically fetch and display the available tools from the remote MCP server. These tools can be referenced in the agent’s core instructions and will appear in the conversation task view. When a tool is run, the agent communicates with the remote MCP server and returns the result directly in the conversation.

<Warning>Local MCP server support (e.g. JSON configuration) is not available.</Warning>

### For Tools

You can access and use your Relevance AI tools via an MCP Server connection.

</div>

1. Go to your Relevance AI workspace
2. Click "More" on the left-side navigation menu, navigate to "MCP servers"
3. Select the tools you want to share with external clients
4. Click "Generate MCP Server Configuration"
5. Copy your MCP configuration into your preferred client

<Tip>
  For Cursor: Open Cursor settings → MCP tab → "Add new MCP server" → Paste into your mcp.json file
</Tip>

## Client-Specific Setup

### Cursor

To use your Relevance AI tools in Cursor:

1. Open Cursor settings
2. Navigate to the MCP tab
3. Click "Add new MCP server"
4. Paste your generated MCP configuration into your mcp.json file
5. Save the configuration

### Claude

To use your Relevance AI tools in Claude:

1. Access Claude's settings
2. Look for the tool or API integration section
3. Add a new MCP server
4. Paste your generated MCP configuration
5. Save the settings

## Best Practices

- **Select tools strategically**: Only expose tools that would be useful in external contexts
- **Test the integration**: After setting up, test each tool to ensure it works as expected
- **Update regularly**: When you update tools in Relevance AI, regenerate your MCP configuration
- **Monitor usage**: Keep track of how your tools are being used across different platforms

## Security Considerations

The MCP Server integration maintains the security of your tools while making them accessible to external clients. Authentication is handled through secure tokens, ensuring that only authorized users can access your tools. All communication between Relevance AI and external clients is encrypted to protect your data.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the MCP Server integration:

- Verify that your MCP configuration is correctly copied into the external client
- Ensure the external client supports the MCP standard
- Check that the selected tools are compatible with the external client
- Confirm your authentication credentials are valid
- Regenerate the MCP configuration if necessary
