Confluence is a powerful collaboration platform that helps teams organize, create, and share knowledge. With Relevance AI's Confluence integration, you can seamlessly connect your Confluence workspace to your AI agents, enabling them to access, create, and update Confluence content, making your knowledge management workflows more efficient and intelligent.

<Warning>
  The Confluence integration in Relevance AI was built by Relevance AI, and is therefore supported by our team, not Atlassian (Confluence's parent company). If you have a question / issue with using Confluence in Relevance AI, please [reach out to our support team](/get-started/support). If you have a question / issue that is only about Confluence, you can [reach out to Atlassian support](https://support.atlassian.com/contact/).
</Warning>

## Connect the integration

Connecting your Confluence account to Relevance AI is a straightforward process:

1. Go to the "Integrations" page in the sidebar of your Relevance AI dashboard.
2. Click on "Confluence" from the available integrations.
3. Click on the "Add Integration" button.
4. In the pop-up window, sign into your Atlassian account.
5. Grant the necessary permissions for Relevance AI to access your Confluence workspace.
6. Once authenticated, your Confluence account will appear as a connected integration.

## Tool steps for Confluence

The Confluence integration provides a rich set of actions that your agents can use to interact with your Confluence workspace. These actions can be incorporated into your agent's workflows as tool steps, enabling sophisticated knowledge management capabilities.

## Use the integration's API tool step (Advanced)

In addition to the pre-built actions available in the tool directory, you can build custom tools that perform Confluence-specific activities using the Confluence API Call tool step:

1. Create a new tool in Relevance AI.
2. Scroll down to Tool-steps.
3. Add the Confluence API Tool step.
4. Select your connected Confluence account in the dropdown.
5. Configure the API endpoint, method, and parameters according to your needs.

This advanced approach gives you full access to the Confluence REST API, allowing you to implement custom functionality beyond what's available in the standard actions.
