Confluence is a powerful collaboration platform that helps teams organize, create, and share knowledge. With Relevance AI's Confluence integration, you can seamlessly connect your Confluence workspace to your AI agents, enabling them to access, create, and update Confluence content, making your knowledge management workflows more efficient and intelligent.

<Warning>
  The Confluence integration in Relevance AI was built by Relevance AI, and is therefore supported by our team, not Atlassian (Confluence's parent company). If you have a question / issue with using Confluence in Relevance AI, please [reach out to our support team](/get-started/support). If you have a question / issue that is only about Confluence, you can [reach out to Atlassian support](https://support.atlassian.com/contact/).
</Warning>

## Connect the integration

Connecting your Confluence account to Relevance AI is a straightforward process:

1. Go to the **Integrations & API Keys** page in the sidebar of your Relevance AI dashboard.
2. Click on "Confluence" from the available integrations.
3. Click on the "Add Integration" button.
4. In the pop-up window, sign into your Atlassian account.
5. Grant the necessary permissions for Relevance AI to access your Confluence workspace.
6. Once authenticated, your Confluence account will appear as a connected integration.

## Tool steps for Confluence

The Confluence integration provides a rich set of actions that your agents can use to interact with your Confluence workspace. These actions can be incorporated into your agent's workflows as tool steps, enabling sophisticated knowledge management capabilities.

## Use the integration's API tool step (Advanced)

In addition to the pre-built actions available in the tool directory, you can build custom tools that perform Confluence-specific activities using the Confluence API Call tool step:

1. Create a new tool in Relevance AI.
2. Scroll down to Tool-steps.
3. Add the Confluence API Tool step.
4. Select your connected Confluence account in the dropdown.
5. Configure the API endpoint, method, and parameters according to your needs.

This advanced approach gives you full access to the Confluence REST API, allowing you to implement custom functionality beyond what's available in the standard actions.

<Warning>
  **Check API Documentation for Required Headers**
  
  The Confluence API Call Tool step does **not** automatically add headers to your requests. Many Confluence REST API v2 endpoints require the `accept: application/json` header to function properly. 
  
  **Always check the [Confluence API documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v2/intro/) for your specific endpoint** to see which headers are required, and add them manually in the Headers section of the API Call Tool step.
</Warning>

### Adding Required Headers

When using the Confluence API Call Tool step, you must manually add any headers required by the endpoint you're calling. The tool does not add these automatically.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the API documentation">
    Before configuring your API call, visit the [Confluence REST API documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v2/intro/) and find your specific endpoint. Look for the "Request" section to see which headers are required.
    
    Many endpoints require the `accept: application/json` header, but requirements vary by endpoint.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add the API Call Tool step">
    In your tool configuration, add the Confluence API Call Tool step and select your connected Confluence account.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure the endpoint">
    Set up your API endpoint and method. For example, to get a page by ID:
    - **Method**: GET
    - **Endpoint**: `/wiki/api/v2/pages/{id}?body-format=storage`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add required headers manually">
    In the Headers section of the API Call Tool step, add any headers specified in the API documentation. For most Confluence REST API v2 endpoints, this includes:
    
    ```json
    {
      "accept": "application/json"
    }
    ```
    
    This header tells the Confluence API to return responses in JSON format. Without it, many endpoints will fail with errors.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Why is this header needed?**
  
  The `accept: application/json` header tells the Confluence API what format you want the response in. Most REST API v2 endpoints require this header to return data in JSON format, which the tool can then process. Without this header, the API may return an error or data in an unexpected format.
</Info>

### Example API Call Configuration

Here's a complete example of calling the Confluence API to retrieve a page by ID. This endpoint requires the `accept: application/json` header according to the [Atlassian documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v2/api-group-page/#api-pages-id-get):

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Configuration">
    **API Method**: GET
    
    **Endpoint**: `/wiki/api/v2/pages/{id}?body-format=storage`
    
    **Headers** (must be added manually):
    ```json
    {
      "accept": "application/json"
    }
    ```
    
    **Path Parameters**:
    - `id`: The ID of the Confluence page you want to retrieve
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Expected Response">
    ```json
    {
      "id": "123456",
      "status": "current",
      "title": "Page Title",
      "spaceId": "789012",
      "body": {
        "storage": {
          "value": "<p>Page content here</p>",
          "representation": "storage"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  **Best Practice**: Always consult the [Confluence API documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v2/intro/) for your specific endpoint before configuring your API call. The documentation will specify all required headers, parameters, and request body formats.
