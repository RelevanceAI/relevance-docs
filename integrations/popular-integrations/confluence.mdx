Confluence is a powerful collaboration platform that helps teams organize, create, and share knowledge. With Relevance AI's Confluence integration, you can seamlessly connect your Confluence workspace to your AI agents, enabling them to access, create, and update Confluence content, making your knowledge management workflows more efficient and intelligent.

<Warning>
  The Confluence integration in Relevance AI was built by Relevance AI, and is therefore supported by our team, not Atlassian (Confluence's parent company). If you have a question / issue with using Confluence in Relevance AI, please [reach out to our support team](/get-started/support). If you have a question / issue that is only about Confluence, you can [reach out to Atlassian support](https://support.atlassian.com/contact/).
</Warning>

## Connect the integration

Connecting your Confluence account to Relevance AI is a straightforward process:

1. Go to the "Integrations" page in the sidebar of your Relevance AI dashboard.
2. Click on "Confluence" from the available integrations.
3. Click on the "Add Integration" button.
4. In the pop-up window, sign into your Atlassian account.
5. Grant the necessary permissions for Relevance AI to access your Confluence workspace.
6. Once authenticated, your Confluence account will appear as a connected integration.

## Tool steps for Confluence

The Confluence integration provides a rich set of actions that your agents can use to interact with your Confluence workspace. These actions can be incorporated into your agent's workflows as tool steps, enabling sophisticated knowledge management capabilities.

## Use the integration's API tool step (Advanced)

In addition to the pre-built actions available in the tool directory, you can build custom tools that perform Confluence-specific activities using the Confluence API Call tool step:

1. Create a new tool in Relevance AI.
2. Scroll down to Tool-steps.
3. Add the Confluence API Tool step.
4. Select your connected Confluence account in the dropdown.
5. Configure the API endpoint, method, and parameters according to your needs.

This advanced approach gives you full access to the Confluence REST API, allowing you to implement custom functionality beyond what's available in the standard actions.

<Warning>
  **Required Headers for API Calls**
  
  When using the Confluence API Call Tool step, you must include the `accept: application/json` header in your requests. Without this header, your API calls will fail with errors.
</Warning>

### Adding Required Headers

To ensure your Confluence API calls work properly, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the API Call Tool step">
    In your tool configuration, add the Confluence API Call Tool step and select your connected Confluence account.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure the endpoint">
    Set up your API endpoint and method. For example, to get a page by ID:
    - **Method**: GET
    - **Endpoint**: `/wiki/api/v2/pages/{id}?body-format=storage`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add the required header">
    In the Headers section of the API Call Tool step, add the following header:
    
    ```json
    {
      "accept": "application/json"
    }
    ```
    
    This header tells the Confluence API to return responses in JSON format, which is required for the tool to process the response correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  The `accept: application/json` header is required for most Confluence REST API v2 endpoints. Always include this header when making custom API calls to avoid errors.
</Tip>

### Example API Call Configuration

Here's a complete example of calling the Confluence API to retrieve a page by ID:

  <Tab title="Configuration">
    **API Method**: GET
    
    **Endpoint**: `/wiki/api/v2/pages/{id}?body-format=storage`
    
    **Headers**:
    ```json
    {
      "accept": "application/json"
    }
    ```
    
    **Path Parameters**:
    - `id`: The ID of the Confluence page you want to retrieve
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Expected Response">
    ```json
    {
      "id": "123456",
      "status": "current",
      "title": "Page Title",
      "spaceId": "789012",
      "body": {
        "storage": {
          "value": "<p>Page content here</p>",
          "representation": "storage"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  You can find Confluence's API documentation [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v2/intro/). Each endpoint's documentation will specify any additional headers or parameters required.

## Example use cases

Here are some ways you can leverage the Confluence integration with your agents:

1. **Documentation Assistant**: Create an agent that automatically updates technical documentation in Confluence when new features are released or code changes are made.
2. **Knowledge Summarizer**: Build an agent that monitors specific Confluence spaces and creates executive summaries of new content added during the week.
3. **Content Organizer**: Deploy an agent that automatically adds appropriate labels to new Confluence pages based on their content analysis.
4. **Meeting Notes Processor**: Create an agent that takes meeting notes, formats them according to your team's template, and posts them to the relevant Confluence space.
5. **Knowledge Gap Identifier**: Build an agent that analyzes your Confluence content and identifies areas where documentation is missing or outdated.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What permissions does the Confluence integration require?">
    The integration requires permissions to read and write content, access spaces, and manage page properties in your Confluence workspace. You can review the specific permissions during the authentication process.

  <Accordion title="Can I restrict my Agent to only access certain spaces in Confluence?">
    Yes, you can configure your tools and triggers to only interact with specific spaces by setting the appropriate filters and parameters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why am I getting errors when using the Confluence API Call Tool?">
    The most common issue is missing the required `accept: application/json` header. Make sure to include this header in all your API calls. If you're still experiencing issues, verify that:
    - Your Confluence account is properly connected
    - You have the necessary permissions for the endpoint you're calling
    - Your endpoint URL and parameters are correctly formatted
    - You're using the correct API version (v2 is recommended)
