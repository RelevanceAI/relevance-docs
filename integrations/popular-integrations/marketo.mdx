Marketo is a leading marketing automation platform that helps businesses manage leads, execute email campaigns, and analyze marketing performance. With Relevance AI's Marketo integration, you can seamlessly connect your Marketo instance to your AI agents, enabling them to retrieve campaign metrics, manage leads, access email statistics, and automate marketing workflows.

<Warning>
  The Marketo integration in Relevance AI was built by Relevance AI, and is therefore supported by our team, not Marketo. If you have a question or issue with using Marketo in Relevance AI, please [reach out to our support team](/get-started/support). If you have a question or issue that is only about Marketo, you can [reach out to Adobe Marketo support](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/home).
</Warning>

## Connect the integration

Connecting your Marketo account to Relevance AI uses API Tool Steps with 2-legged OAuth 2.0 authentication. Follow these steps to set up the connection:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your Marketo API credentials">
    You'll need three pieces of information from your Marketo instance:
    
    1. **Client ID**
    2. **Client Secret**
    3. **REST API Endpoint**
    
    To obtain these credentials:
    
    1. Log into your Marketo instance as an administrator
    2. Navigate to **Admin** > **Integration** > **LaunchPoint**
    3. Click **New** > **New Service**
    4. Configure the service:
       - **Display Name**: Enter a name (e.g., "Relevance AI Integration")
       - **Service**: Select "Custom"
       - **Description**: Optional description
       - **API Only User**: Select an API-only user (or create one in Admin > Users & Roles)
    5. Click **Create**
    6. Click **View Details** on your newly created service
    7. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
    
    To get your REST API Endpoint:
    1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Integration** > **Web Services**
    2. Find the **REST API** section
    3. Copy the **Endpoint** URL (e.g., `https://123-ABC-456.mktorest.com/rest`)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Store credentials in Relevance AI">
    When configuring the Marketo API Call tool step in your tools, you'll need to provide these credentials for authentication. Keep them secure and accessible for when you build your Marketo-connected tools.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test your connection">
    Once you've added the credentials to a tool step, test the connection by making a simple API call (e.g., retrieving leads or campaigns) to ensure everything is configured correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Authentication Method**: Marketo uses 2-legged OAuth 2.0. As of June 2025, authentication requires a Bearer token in the Authorization header. The Marketo API Call tool step handles token generation and refresh automatically.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I get Marketo API credentials?">
    To get your Marketo API credentials:
    
    1. Log into Marketo as an administrator
    2. Go to **Admin** > **Integration** > **LaunchPoint**
    3. Create a new service with type "Custom"
    4. Assign an API-only user to the service
    5. View the service details to get your Client ID and Client Secret
    6. Get your REST API Endpoint from **Admin** > **Integration** > **Web Services**
    
    You'll need all three pieces of information (Client ID, Client Secret, and REST API Endpoint) to authenticate with the Marketo API.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What are Marketo's API rate limits?">
    Marketo enforces rate limits on API calls:
    
    - **Standard limit**: 100 calls per 20 seconds
    - **Daily quota**: Varies by subscription (typically 10,000-50,000 calls per day)
    
    Your agents should be designed to handle rate limiting gracefully. The Marketo API will return a 606 error code when rate limits are exceeded. Consider implementing retry logic with exponential backoff for production workflows.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How does authentication work with the Marketo API?">
    Marketo uses 2-legged OAuth 2.0 authentication. When you provide your Client ID, Client Secret, and REST API Endpoint to the Marketo API Call tool step, it automatically:
    
    1. Requests an access token from Marketo's identity service
    2. Includes the Bearer token in the Authorization header of API requests
    3. Handles token refresh when tokens expire (typically after 3600 seconds)
    
    You don't need to manage tokens manually - the tool step handles this automatically.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why am I getting authentication errors?">
    Common authentication issues include:
    
    - **Invalid credentials**: Double-check your Client ID, Client Secret, and REST API Endpoint
    - **API user permissions**: Ensure the API user assigned to your LaunchPoint service has appropriate permissions
    - **Expired tokens**: The tool step should handle token refresh automatically, but network issues can sometimes cause problems
    - **Incorrect endpoint URL**: Make sure you're using the correct REST API endpoint for your Marketo instance
    
    If problems persist, try creating a new LaunchPoint service with a fresh set of credentials.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I retrieve historical campaign data?">
    Yes! You can retrieve historical campaign data using various Marketo API endpoints:
    
    - Use the Activities API to get historical lead activities
    - Retrieve email program statistics for past campaigns
    - Access landing page performance data
    - Query lead changes and updates over time
    
    Note that data retention policies may vary based on your Marketo subscription level.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Smart Campaigns and Email Programs?">
    - **Smart Campaigns**: Automated workflows that can include multiple steps, triggers, and actions. Use the Campaigns API endpoints to trigger or schedule these.
    - **Email Programs**: Specifically designed for email marketing with built-in A/B testing and reporting. Use the Email Programs API endpoints to retrieve content and statistics.
    
    Both can be accessed through the Marketo API Call tool step using their respective endpoints.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I handle pagination in API responses?">
    Many Marketo API endpoints return paginated results. To handle pagination:
    
    1. Check the response for `nextPageToken` in the result
    2. Use the token in subsequent requests with the `nextPageToken` parameter
    3. Continue until no `nextPageToken` is returned
    
    Consider using looping in your tools to automatically retrieve all pages of results.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I create custom fields through the API?">
    Yes, you can create and manage custom fields using the Lead Database API. However, custom field creation requires specific API permissions. Ensure your API user has the necessary permissions in Marketo's role settings under **Admin** > **Users & Roles**.
  </Accordion>
