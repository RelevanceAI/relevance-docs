## Setting up triggers

The WhatsApp Business integration allows you to create powerful triggers that automatically activate your AI agents when specific events occur. This enables seamless customer engagement without manual intervention.

<Warning>The Whatsapp for Business Trigger is considered a Premium trigger, and is only available to Team plans and above. If you use this Trigger, you will incur an additional 5000 credits per month for each connected account in your organization.</Warning>

To set up a WhatsApp trigger:

1. Go to your agent's profile page
2. Under "Triggers", select "WhatsApp Business"
3. Configure the trigger settings:
   - **Trigger on new messages**: Activate your agent when a customer sends a message to your WhatsApp Business number
   - **Trigger on specific keywords**: Set your agent to respond only when certain keywords or phrases are detected
   - **Trigger based on customer attributes**: Configure triggers based on customer data or conversation context

Once configured, your agent will automatically engage with customers through WhatsApp when the trigger conditions are met.
