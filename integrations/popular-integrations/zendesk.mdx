  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Map Variables">
    Map Zendesk ticket data (subject, description, requester, priority, etc.) to your agent's input variables.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test and Activate">
    Test your trigger to ensure it works correctly, then activate it to start automating your support workflows.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use the Integration's API Tool Step (Advanced)

For advanced use cases, you can use the **Zendesk API Call** tool step to make custom API requests to any Zendesk endpoint. This gives you access to the full Zendesk API beyond the pre-built tool steps.

### How to use the Zendesk API Call tool step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Tool Step">
    In your agent or tool builder, add the **Zendesk API Call** tool step.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select HTTP Method">
    Choose the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter the Endpoint">
    Provide the API endpoint path (e.g., `/api/v2/users.json` or `/api/v2/tickets/12345.json`).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Request Body">
    For POST, PUT, or PATCH requests, provide the request body in JSON format.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Response Handling">
    Map the API response to variables in your workflow for further processing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test the Request">
    Test your API call to ensure it returns the expected data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Adding Tags to a Ticket

```json
{
  "method": "PUT",
  "endpoint": "/api/v2/tickets/12345.json",
  "body": {
    "ticket": {
      "tags": ["urgent", "vip", "billing"]
