Trello is a flexible personal productivity and work management tool that helps individuals and teams visually organize tasks, ideas, and workflows using boards, lists, and cards. It’s designed to adapt to a wide range of use cases — from planning daily to-dos and tracking habits to managing team coordination or creative pipelines. With its drag-and-drop interface, customizable labels, and integrations with tools like Slack, Google Drive, and now Relevance AI, Trello makes it easy to stay on top of work, whether you’re managing solo projects or collaborating asynchronously.

## Connect the Integration

Setting up the Trello integration with Relevance AI is straightforward:

1. Navigate to the Integrations & App Keys section in your Relevance AI dashboard
2. Find and select "Trello" from the available integrations
3. Click "Connect"
4. You'll be redirected to Trello to authorize the connection
5. Log in to your Trello account (or create one if needed)
6. Review and approve the permissions requested
7. Once authorized, you'll be redirected back to Relevance AI with the integration active

After connecting, your Relevance AI agents will be able to interact with your Trello account, accessing boards, creating cards, and managing your Trello workflows.

## Tool steps for Trello

The Trello integration provides a rich set of actions that your agents can use to interact with Trello. These actions can be incorporated into your agent’s workflows to automate design-related tasks.
