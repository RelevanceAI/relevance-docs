Trello is a flexible personal productivity and work management tool that helps individuals and teams visually organize tasks, ideas, and workflows using boards, lists, and cards. It's designed to adapt to a wide range of use cases — from planning daily to-dos and tracking habits to managing team coordination or creative pipelines. With its drag-and-drop interface, customizable labels, and integrations with tools like Slack, Google Drive, and now Relevance AI, Trello makes it easy to stay on top of work, whether you're managing solo projects or collaborating asynchronously.

<Warning>
  The Trello integration in Relevance AI was built by Relevance AI, and is therefore supported by our team, not Atlassian (Trello's parent company). If you have a question / issue with using Trello in Relevance AI, please [reach out to our support team](/get-started/support). If you have a question / issue that is only about Trello, you can [reach out to Atlassian support](https://support.atlassian.com/contact/).
</Warning>

## Connect the Integration

Setting up the Trello integration with Relevance AI is straightforward:

1. Navigate to the Integrations & App Keys section in your Relevance AI dashboard
2. Find and select "Trello" from the available integrations
3. Click "Connect"
4. You'll be redirected to Trello to authorize the connection
5. Log in to your Trello account (or create one if needed)
6. Review and approve the permissions requested
7. Once authorized, you'll be redirected back to Relevance AI with the integration active

After connecting, your Relevance AI agents will be able to interact with your Trello account, accessing boards, creating cards, and managing your Trello workflows.

## Setting up triggers

The Trello integration allows you to set up triggers that automatically activate your AI agents when specific events occur in your Trello boards. Most Trello triggers are **instant** (webhook-based), meaning your agents respond in real-time as soon as changes happen — whether it's a new card being created, a comment being added, or a card moving between lists. This enables powerful automation workflows that keep your team productive without manual intervention.

### How to configure Trello triggers

To set up Trello as a trigger source:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access trigger settings">
    Create or edit an agent in Relevance AI, then navigate to the **Triggers** section in **Agent Profile**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Trello as trigger source">
    Click **Add Trigger** and select **Trello** from the available trigger sources.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect your Trello account">
    Select your connected Trello account from the dropdown (or connect a new account if needed).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose your trigger event">
    Select the specific Trello event that should activate your agent from the available trigger types (see full list below).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure trigger settings">
    Depending on the trigger type, configure additional settings such as:
    - **Board selection**: Choose which Trello board(s) to monitor
    - **List filtering**: Specify particular lists to watch (for card-related triggers)
    - **Card filtering**: Set conditions for which cards should trigger the agent
    - **Frequency settings**: For non-instant triggers, set how often to check for changes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save and activate">
    Save your trigger configuration. Your agent will now automatically activate when the specified Trello events occur.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tool steps for Trello

The Trello integration provides a rich set of actions that your agents can use to interact with Trello. These actions can be incorporated into your agent's workflows to automate tasks.

<Snippet file="components/integrations/trello-tool-steps.mdx"/>

## Use the integration's API tool step (advanced)

In addition to the pre-built actions available in the tool directory, you can build custom tools that perform Trello-specific activities using the Trello API Call tool step:

1. Create a new tool in Relevance AI.
2. Scroll down to Tool steps.
3. Add the Trello API Tool step.
4. Select your connected Trello account in the dropdown.
5. Configure the API endpoint, method, and parameters according to your needs.

This advanced approach gives you full access to the Trello REST API, allowing you to implement custom functionality beyond what's available in the standard actions.
