### Example: Retrieve Meeting Transcript

Here's a practical example of using the Fireflies API Call tool step to retrieve a meeting transcript:

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "endpoint": "/graphql",
  "method": "POST",
  "body": {
    "query": "query Transcript($transcriptId: String!) { transcript(id: $transcriptId) { title date sentences { text speaker_name } } }"
  }
}
```

This configuration:
- Uses the POST method for GraphQL queries
- Retrieves transcript details including title, date, and speaker-identified sentences
- Returns structured data that can be used in subsequent workflow steps
