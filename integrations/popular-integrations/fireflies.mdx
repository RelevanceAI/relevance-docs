Fireflies.ai is an AI-powered meeting assistant that automatically transcribes, summarizes, searches, and analyzes voice conversations across all major video conferencing platforms including Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Webex, and more. With industry-leading 90%+ transcription accuracy, Fireflies helps teams capture and extract valuable insights from every meeting.

With Relevance AI's Fireflies integration, you can seamlessly connect your meeting data to your AI agents, enabling them to access transcripts, retrieve meeting details, process audio files, and automate post-meeting workflows, making your meeting intelligence more actionable and accessible.

### Example: Retrieving Meeting Transcripts

Here's a practical example of using the Fireflies API Call tool step to retrieve meeting transcripts with summaries:

**GraphQL Query Example**:
```graphql
query Transcripts {
  transcripts {
    id
    title
    date
    duration
    transcript_url
    summary {
      keywords
      action_items
      outline
      shorthand_bullet
      overview
      bullet_gist
    }
    participants {
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

This query retrieves:
- Meeting metadata (ID, title, date, duration)
- Transcript URL for full content access
- AI-generated summary with keywords, action items, and overview
- Participant information
