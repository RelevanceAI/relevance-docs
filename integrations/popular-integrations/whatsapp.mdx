## Connect the integration

Connecting your WhatsApp account to Relevance AI is a straightforward process:

1. Go to the "Integrations" page in the sidebar.
2. Click on "WhatsApp".
3. Click on the "Add Integration" button.
4. In the pop-up window, sign into your WhatsApp Business account.
5. Follow the authorization steps to grant Relevance AI access to your WhatsApp account.

## Setting up triggers

WhatsApp Integration can be configured as a trigger for your AI agents, allowing them to automatically respond when messages are received through WhatsApp.

<Warning>The Whatsapp Trigger is considered a Premium trigger, and is only available to Team plans and above. If you use this Trigger, you will incur an additional 5000 credits per month for each connected account in your organization.</Warning>

To set up WhatsApp as a trigger:

1. Create a new agent or edit an existing one.
2. Navigate to the "Triggers" section in "Agent Profile".
3. Select "WhatsApp" from the available triggers.
4. Choose the WhatsApp account you want to connect to this agent.
5. Configure trigger conditions (optional):
   - Respond to all incoming messages
   - Respond only to specific contacts or groups
   - Respond based on message content filters
6. Save your trigger configuration.

Once set up, your agent will automatically activate when new WhatsApp messages that match your trigger conditions are received, enabling real-time customer engagement.
