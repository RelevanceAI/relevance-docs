## Why do you need to warmup your email inbox?

Email warmups refer to the process of gradually increasing the volume of emails sent from a new or unused email account to build a positive sender reputation with internet service providers (ISPs).

A warmedup email inbox helps you to avoid spam filters and ensure better deliverability rates.

We recommend that you create an email account especially for your email inbox manager agents. So warming up their inbox before sending out emails from their account will help your email marketing/inbox management campaigns start successfully.

## How to warmup your emails?

The process usually involvesn sending a small number of emails initially and slowly increasing the quantity over time. Start by sending a few emails to active, engaged recipients like colleagues who are likely to open and interact with your agent's emails.

## Add email warmup integration to your Relevance account

You can use an in-built Relevance integration to warm up your chosen email account, by activating the email warmup integration.
