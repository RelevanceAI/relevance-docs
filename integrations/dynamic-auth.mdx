<Warning>
  Dynamic Auth is a new feature coming Q1 2026. This feature is not yet available but will be rolling out soon.

  If you have questions about this feature, please reach out to your sales representative if you're on an Enterprise subscription, or [contact our support team](/get-started/support) if you're on another plan.
</Warning>

Dynamic Auth enables agents to operate using each user's individual authentication accounts for integrations, allowing multiple users to safely and privately use the same shared agent (especially in Chat) while only accessing their own data. Builders can configure this behavior per tool input, and users only need to authenticate once per integration.

## How Dynamic Auth works

Dynamic Auth changes how authentication works when multiple people use the same agent. Instead of everyone using a single shared account to access integrations (like Google Drive, Slack, or HubSpot), each user connects their own personal accounts.

This means that when multiple team members use the same agent, each person only sees and accesses their own data within the connected integrations.

## Why use Dynamic Auth

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Enhanced Security" icon="shield-check">
    Each user accesses integrations with their own credentials and permissions, reducing the security risks of shared accounts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Privacy Protection" icon="user-lock">
    Users only see their own data. When an agent queries Google Drive or searches through emails, it only accesses the data that user has permission to see.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Access Control" icon="user-shield">
    Users can only access what they're authorized to see in the external integration, based on their own account permissions rather than a shared account's permissions.

  <Card title="Simplified Management" icon="users-gear">
    No need to manage shared credentials or worry about what happens when team members leave. Each user manages their own connections.

    Actions taken by agents are attributed to individual user accounts in external integrations, making it easier to track who did what.

## Setting up individual account authentication

As a builder, you can configure Dynamic Auth at the tool input level. If you want to enable Dynamic Auth for a tool step that currently has authentication configured directly on the step, you'll need to convert that authentication to a tool input instead.

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmhe9r2w33m1bfatipia57zjj" frameBorder="0" title="Enable individual account authentication at tool input level" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

To enable individual account authentication at the tool input level:

1. Enter the Tool you want to configure and make sure you're on the Build tab
2. Navigate to the OAuth Input you want to enable Dynamic Auth on and click the Shield icon
3. Toggle on the switch next to 'Individual account authentication required'

When this is enabled, any agent using this tool will require each user to authenticate with their own account for this integration.

<Tip>
If you have authentication configured directly on a tool step and want to enable Dynamic Auth, you'll need to convert that authentication to a tool input field. This allows each user to provide their own credentials when using the tool.
</Tip>

<Note>
For Enterprise customers: If you have [asset-level authentication controls](/get-started/enterprise/rbac#permissions) enabled through RBAC, users can also choose from project-level shared accounts instead of authorizing their individual accounts.
</Note>

## User experience in Chat

When users interact with an agent in Chat that has Dynamic Auth enabled, the authentication flow is seamless and intuitive.

### First-time authentication

When a user runs an agent that requires individual account authentication for the first time, they'll see a modal prompt asking them to connect their account:

1. The agent begins running and encounters a tool that requires individual authentication
2. A modal appears asking the user to **'Connect your account'** for the specific integration (e.g., "Connect your Google Drive account")
3. The user can either:
   - **Select an existing credential** they've already connected to Relevance AI
   - **Add a new credential** by clicking the button to authenticate with the integration
   - **Set as default** - mark a credential as their default for this integration
4. Once authenticated, the agent continues running with that user's credentials
5. The authentication is remembered for future runs

<Info>
Users are only prompted once per integration during an agent execution. If an agent uses multiple tools that access Google Drive, for example, the user only needs to authenticate once and those credentials will be reused across all Google Drive operations in that run.
</Info>

### Subsequent uses

After the first authentication:

- The agent automatically uses the user's saved credentials
- No interruption to the agent's execution
- Users can change their default credentials in project settings if needed

### Multiple integrations

If an agent uses multiple integrations (for example, both Google Drive and Slack), users will be prompted to authenticate each integration the first time they're encountered. After initial setup, all credentials are remembered and reused automatically.

## Managing default authentication

Users can manage their default authentication accounts for each integration at the project level, making it easy to control which accounts are used by agents.

### Setting integration defaults

To set or change your default account for an integration:

1. Click on 'Integrations & API Keys' in the sidebar
2. Click on the integration you want to configure

<Tip>
Integration defaults pre-populate when you create new assets or use assets for the first time, saving you time and ensuring consistency across your agent interactions.
</Tip>

### Privacy and account visibility

To protect privacy and security:

- **Private accounts are hidden** - Your personal accounts won't be visible to other users
- **Auths are private by default** - When you connect a new account, it's automatically set as private
- **Enterprise shared accounts** - If your organization has shared project-level accounts (Enterprise only), you'll see those as options alongside your personal accounts

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I need to change my authentication credentials?">
    If you need to change your authentication credentials, you can do so easily. During Chat, you'll receive modal prompts that allow you to select existing credentials, add new ones, or mark a new credential as default. You can also manage your default credentials by going to Integrations & API Keys in the sidebar and selecting the integration you want to reconfigure.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use both shared accounts and individual accounts in the same project?">
    Yes, if you're on an Enterprise subscription with asset-level authentication controls enabled. When Dynamic Auth is configured for a tool input, Enterprise users will see both their individual accounts and any shared project-level accounts available for selection. This gives you flexibility to choose the appropriate account based on the context. Non-Enterprise users will only see their individual accounts.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What integrations support Dynamic Auth?">
    Dynamic Auth works with all integrations that require authentication in Relevance AI. This includes popular integrations like Google Drive, Gmail, Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, and many others. The feature is integration-agnostic and will work with any tool that uses an authenticated connection.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is this feature only available on Enterprise plans?">
    No, Dynamic Auth is available to all users on all plans. While some related features like asset-level authentication controls and shared project accounts are Enterprise-only, the core Dynamic Auth functionality that allows individual user authentication is available to everyone.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Where can I use Dynamic Auth - just in Chat or everywhere?">
    Dynamic Auth applies to both Chat and in-app functionality (the Run tab). Whether you're using an agent through Chat or running it directly in the web application, Dynamic Auth will ensure each user's individual credentials are used when configured.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When I first add a tool to an agent, what setting does it use?">
    It will use the agent input setting from the tool. When the user changes the input setting on the agent tool section page, it will no longer use the setting on the tool but will use the value set on the agent.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="If I have a default value set on the tool and the agent, what value will it use?">
    If the agent input setting is `let agent decide` or `set manually`, it will prioritise using the default value set on the agent. If there is none, it will fallback to the tool default value. This is different for `Per-user authentication` which does not fall back to the tool default value. It will only use the value the current user in session has set for that agent.
