## Setting up Triggers

The Canva integration can be configured as a trigger for your AI agents, allowing them to automatically respond to events in your Canva account. This creates powerful workflows where design activities can initiate AI-driven processes.

To set up a Canva trigger *(coming soon)*:

1. Navigate to your agent's configuration page (”Agent profile”)
2. Under "Triggers" choose "Canva" from the available trigger sources
