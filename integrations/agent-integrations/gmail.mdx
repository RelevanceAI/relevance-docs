To set up Gmail as a trigger:

   - **Unread Emails**: Trigger only for unread messages
5. Set the frequency of checking for new emails (e.g., immediately, every 5 minutes, hourly).
6. Save your trigger configuration.

Once set up, your agent will automatically start working whenever the specified email conditions are met, allowing for seamless email automation.

### Example: Custom Email Processing with Gmail API

Here's an example of using the Gmail API tool step to implement a custom email processing workflow:

```json
// Example of using Gmail API to process emails with specific criteria
{
  "method": "GET",
  "endpoint": "users/me/messages",
  "params": {
    "q": "is:unread from:important-client@example.com",
    "maxResults": 10
  }
}
```

This API call retrieves up to 10 unread emails from a specific sender, which your agent can then process according to your business rules.
