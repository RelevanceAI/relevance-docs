## API Triggers for Agents

API Triggers empower developers to programmatically activate Relevance AI agents, creating powerful automation workflows that integrate seamlessly with your existing systems and applications.

## Overview

API Triggers allow you to initiate agent tasks directly through the Relevance AI API, enabling programmatic control over when and how your agents are activated. This capability is particularly valuable for developers and technical teams who want to incorporate AI agents into their applications, services, or automated workflows.

With API Triggers, you can build sophisticated systems where your agents respond to events in your custom applications, process data from proprietary systems, or execute tasks based on complex business logic that you define.

## How API Triggers Work

API Triggers function by exposing endpoints in the Relevance AI API that allow you to:

1. Initiate a new conversation with an agent
2. Send messages to an existing conversation
3. Provide context and data for the agent to process
4. Receive responses and actions taken by the agent

When you make an API call to trigger an agent, the agent processes the provided information according to its configuration and instructions, then performs the appropriate actions based on its capabilities and the data received.

## Setting Up API Triggers

To set up and use API Triggers for your agents:

1. Navigate to your agent's profile in the Relevance AI interface
2. In the left sidebar, click on "Integrations"
3. Under the "Agent profile" section, locate the "Integrations" area
4. Select "API Trigger" from the available trigger options
5. Configure the API Trigger settings according to your requirements
6. Save your configuration

Once configured, you'll receive the necessary API credentials and endpoint information to begin making API calls to your agent.

## Using API Triggers

To use API Triggers in your applications or scripts:

### Authentication

First, authenticate your API requests using your Relevance AI API key:

```python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

### Triggering an Agent

To trigger an agent via the API:

```python
# Example: Initiating a new conversation with an agent
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.relevanceai.com/v1/agents/{agent_id}/conversations",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "message": "Process this customer inquiry",
        "context": {
            "customer_id": "12345",
            "inquiry_type": "billing_question",
            "priority": "high"
        }
    }
)

conversation_id = response.json()["conversation_id"]
```

### Continuing a Conversation

To send additional messages to an existing conversation:

```python
# Example: Sending a follow-up message to an existing conversation
requests.post(
    f"https://api.relevanceai.com/v1/agents/{agent_id}/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "message": "Here's the additional information you requested",
        "attachments": [
            {
                "type": "file",
                "url": "https://example.com/customer_records.pdf"
            }
        ]
    }
)
```

## Customizing API Trigger Behavior

When configuring API Triggers, you can customize how your agent processes the incoming data:

- **Input Mapping**: Define how data fields in your API request map to variables the agent can use
- **Context Handling**: Specify how contextual information should be processed and presented to the agent
- **Response Formatting**: Configure how the agent's responses should be structured in API responses
- **Workflow Integration**: Define specific workflows the agent should follow based on API request parameters

These customization options ensure your agent aligns perfectly with your application's requirements and business processes.

## Advanced API Trigger Features

### Batch Processing

For scenarios requiring processing of multiple items, you can use batch API calls:

```python
# Example: Batch processing multiple customer inquiries
requests.post(
    f"https://api.relevanceai.com/v1/agents/{agent_id}/batch",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "items": [
            {
                "customer_id": "12345",
                "inquiry": "Billing question about my recent invoice"
            },
            {
                "customer_id": "67890",
                "inquiry": "Need to update shipping address"
            }
        ],
        "options": {
            "priority": "normal",
            "notification_email": "admin@example.com"
        }
    }
)
```

### Webhook Callbacks

Configure your API Trigger to send webhook callbacks when the agent completes tasks:

```python
# Example: Setting up webhook callbacks
requests.post(
    f"https://api.relevanceai.com/v1/agents/{agent_id}/conversations",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "message": "Process this customer inquiry",
        "context": {
            "customer_id": "12345"
        },
        "callback": {
            "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
            "headers": {
                "X-Custom-Header": "value"
            }
        }
    }
)
```

## Integration Examples

### CRM Integration

```python
# Example: Triggering an agent when a high-value lead is created in your CRM
def on_new_lead(lead_data):
    if lead_data["score"] > 80:  # High-value lead
        requests.post(
            f"https://api.relevanceai.com/v1/agents/{agent_id}/conversations",
            headers=headers,
            json={
                "message": "Research this high-value lead",
                "context": lead_data
            }
        )
```

### Customer Support System

```python
# Example: Triggering an agent for urgent support tickets
def on_new_support_ticket(ticket):
    if ticket["priority"] == "urgent":
        requests.post(

            f"https://api.relevanceai.com/v1/agents/{agent_id}/conversations",
            headers=headers,
            json={
                "message": "Handle this urgent support ticket",
                "context": ticket
            }
        )
```

## Best Practices for API Triggers

1. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in your API integration code
2. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits and implement appropriate throttling
3. **Security**: Store API keys securely and use environment variables rather than hardcoding them
4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for your API trigger usage to detect issues early
5. **Testing**: Thoroughly test your API trigger implementation in a development environment before deploying to production
