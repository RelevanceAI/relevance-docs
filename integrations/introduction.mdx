## Overview

Integrations serve as bridges between your AI agents and the external services you rely on daily. By establishing these connections, you can create seamless workflows that span across multiple platforms, allowing your agents to access data from and perform actions within your entire digital ecosystem.

For new users, it's important to understand that integrations enable four key capabilities:

1. **Connecting external services** to your Relevance AI account
2. **Setting up triggers** that automatically activate your agents based on external events
3. **Using pre-built actions** that allow your agents to interact with external platforms
4. **Creating custom API calls** for advanced integration scenarios

Let's explore each of these capabilities in detail.

## 1. Connecting Integrations

The first step in leveraging integrations is connecting your external services to Relevance AI:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations & API Keys** page from the left-hand menu of your Relevance AI account
2. Browse the available integrations and select the service you want to connect
3. Click on the integration card to begin the connection process
4. Follow the authentication steps to authorize the connection (typically involves logging into the service or providing API credentials)
5. Once connected, the integration will appear as "Connected" in your list of available integrations


<div
  style={{
    position: 'relative',
    boxSizing: 'content-box',
    maxHeight: '80vh',
    maxHeight: '80svh',
    width: '100%',
    aspectRatio: '2.0041753653444676',
    padding: '40px 0'
  }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cm90wzs6k1ieheyp0a704pbpd?embed_v=2"
    loading="lazy"
    title="Connecting integrations"
    allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen"
    frameBorder="0"
    webkitAllowFullscreen="true"
    mozAllowFullscreen="true"
    allowFullscreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%'
    }}
  />
</div>

Each integration may have specific configuration options depending on the service. The platform guides you through the necessary steps to establish a secure and functional connection.

### Connecting LLM Accounts

<div
  style={{
    position: 'relative',
    boxSizing: 'content-box',
    maxHeight: '80vh',
    maxHeight: '80svh',
    width: '100%',
    aspectRatio: '2.0041753653444676',
    padding: '40px 0'
  }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cm90ybkeb1ir3eyp09mxcynmk?embed_v=2"
    loading="lazy"
    title="Adding API keys"
    allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen"
    frameBorder="0"
    webkitAllowFullscreen="true"
    mozAllowFullscreen="true"
    allowFullscreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%'
    }}
  />
</div>

A particularly valuable integration option is connecting your own Large Language Model (LLM) accounts:

1. Go to the **Integrations & API Keys** page in the left-hand menu
2. Look for the LLM provider you want to connect (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google)
3. Click on the provider and enter your API key
4. Once connected, you can use your own LLM account with your agents

This capability allows you to leverage your existing LLM subscriptions and manage usage under your own account, giving you greater control over your AI resources and potentially reducing costs.

## 2. Setting Up Triggers

Triggers are events from integrated platforms that automatically activate your agents. This transforms your agents from reactive tools that wait for instructions into proactive assistants that respond to events in your digital environment.

### How to Set Up Triggers:

1. Go to the **Agent Settings** page for the agent you want to configure
2. Select **Agent Profile** from the menu
3. Locate the **Triggers** section
4. Click **"Add Trigger"** and select from the available trigger options
5. Configure the trigger settings according to your needs
6. Save your changes

<div
  style={{
    position: 'relative',
    boxSizing: 'content-box',
    maxHeight: '80vh',
    maxHeight: '80svh',
    width: '100%',
    aspectRatio: '1.8057022175290391',
    padding: '40px 0'
  }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cm928e0t62ej5eyp0uej7b0h0?embed_v=2"
    loading="lazy"
    title="Setting up triggers"
    allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen"
    frameBorder="0"
    webkitAllowFullscreen="true"
    mozAllowFullscreen="true"
    allowFullscreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%'
    }}
  />
</div>

### Common Trigger Examples:

- **Email Integrations (Gmail, Outlook)**: Trigger an agent when you receive an email matching specific criteria
- **CRM Integrations (HubSpot, Salesforce)**: Activate an agent when a new contact is created or a deal stage changes
- **Support Integrations (Freshdesk, Zendesk)**: Start an agent workflow when a new support ticket is created
- **Messaging Integrations (Slack, WhatsApp Business)**: Trigger an agent when a message is received in a specific channel

For example, with the HubSpot integration, you could set up a trigger that activates your sales assistant agent whenever a new lead is created in your CRM. The agent could then automatically research the lead, prepare a personalized outreach message, and schedule a follow-up task.

## 3. Tools & Tool Steps (Actions)

This is where integrations truly shine! Once connected, integrations provide a library of pre-built actions that your agents can use to interact with external platforms. These actions can be incorporated into your agent's workflows at any point, not just as triggers.

### How to Add Integration Actions to Your Agent:

1. Go to the **Agent Settings** page for your agent
2. Select **Tools** under "Connected Resources" in the sidebar
3. Click **"+ Add tool"** to open the tool library
4. Search for the integration name (e.g., "HubSpot" or "Slack")
5. Browse the available actions for that integration
6. Select the action you want to add and click **"+ Add"**
7. Configure any required parameters for the action
8. Save your changes

<div
  style={{
    position: 'relative',
    boxSizing: 'content-box',
    maxHeight: '80vh',
    maxHeight: '80svh',
    width: '100%',
    aspectRatio: '1.8057022175290391',
    padding: '40px 0'
  }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cm928q3zo2ejzeyp0vhb354og?embed_v=2"
    loading="lazy"
    title="Adding integration actions"
    allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen"
    frameBorder="0"
    webkitAllowFullscreen="true"
    mozAllowFullscreen="true"
    allowFullscreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%'
    }}
  />
</div>

### Examples of Powerful Integration Actions:

**Slack Integration Actions:**
- Send a message to a specific channel
- Create a new channel
- Search for messages
- Update a message
- Upload a file
- Create a poll
- And many more!

**Google Calendar Integration Actions:**
- Create a new event
- Check availability
- Update an existing event
- Send calendar invites
- Get upcoming events
- Delete events
- And many more!

**HubSpot Integration Actions:**
- Create or update contacts
- Add notes to contact records
- Create deals
- Update deal stages
- Create tasks
- Search for contacts
- Get contact properties
- And many more!

**Notion Integration Actions:**
- Create a new page
- Update page content
- Search for pages
- Create databases
- Add items to databases
- Comment on pages
- And many more!

These actions are the building blocks of powerful workflows. For example, your agent could use the HubSpot "Get Contact" action to retrieve customer information, then use the "Create Task" action to set up a follow-up, and finally use the Slack "Send Message" action to notify your sales team.

The beauty of these actions is that they can be used in any combination and at any point in your agent's workflow. You're not limited to a predefined sequence - you can create custom workflows that perfectly match your business processes.

## 4. Using the Integration's API Tool Step (Advanced)

For advanced users who need more flexibility than the pre-built actions provide, Relevance AI offers direct API access to your connected integrations:

1. Create a new tool in the **Tools** section
2. Scroll down to **Tool Steps**
3. Click **"+ Add Step"**
4. Search for and select the integration's API tool step (e.g., "HubSpot API")
5. Select your connected account from the dropdown
6. Configure the API endpoint, method, and parameters
7. Save your tool

This advanced capability allows you to access any functionality exposed by the integration's API, even if there isn't a pre-built action for it yet. It's perfect for custom workflows that require specialized interactions with your external services.

## Creating Powerful Cross-Platform Workflows

The true power of integrations comes from combining multiple actions across different platforms into cohesive workflows. Here's an example of how you might use integrations to automate a lead nurturing process:

1. A new lead is created in HubSpot (trigger)
2. Your agent uses the Google Search action to research the lead's company
3. The agent uses the HubSpot action to add research notes to the contact record
4. The agent uses the Gmail action to send a personalized introduction email
5. The agent uses the Google Calendar action to schedule a follow-up task
6. The agent uses the Slack action to notify the sales team about the new lead

All of this happens automatically, without any manual intervention required. These workflows can dramatically increase efficiency, reduce human error, and ensure consistent execution of your business processes.

## Best Practices for Using Integrations

To get the most out of your integrations:

1. **Start with clear goals**: Define what you want to achieve with each integration before setting it up
2. **Begin with simple workflows**: Start with basic trigger-action combinations before building complex multi-step processes
3. **Test thoroughly**: Always test your integration workflows with sample data before deploying them
4. **Monitor performance**: Regularly check that your integrations are functioning as expected
5. **Secure your credentials**: Follow security best practices when connecting integrations, especially when using API keys
6. **Document your workflows**: Keep track of how data flows between systems for easier troubleshooting and optimization
