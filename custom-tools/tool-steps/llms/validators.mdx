One of the biggest roadblocks with using LLMs is when they return invalid content. For example, you may 
ask for a specific format of JSON, but the LLM returns an explanation that breaks it in your `JSON.parse()`.

To protect against this, Relevance has provided you with a quality control feature called `Validators`. 
You can specify a schema you want to apply to your prompt, and this component validates the LLM's response
against the desired and specified schema. 
If the LLM returns invalid data, in a second step the LLM is asked to fix its response. If that fails, an error
message will be returned to your application. This way, you can rest assured your application will always receive 
valid data or error gracefully.

There are three options available, but we will always be adding more:
* Regex (regular expression): check if the output matches the provided regular expression
* Is_json: check if the output is a valid json
* JsonSchema: checks if the response matches the specified schema. A sample prompt and schema are provided below

### `is_json`

This validates whether the LLM has returned **only** JSON. It will try to fix it if not. This doesn't require any additional properties.

<Warning>
    The `prompt_completion` transformation will still return a string, but you
    will be safe to `JSON.parse()` it.
</Warning>

### `jsonschema`

If you would like to validate a specific format of JSON, you can take advantage of [JSONSchema](https://cswr.github.io/JsonSchema/spec/basic_types/)! Provide the schema as the `schema` property.

```ts
{
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
        title: { type: 'string' },
        description: { type: 'string' }
    }
}
```

<Warning>
    The `prompt_completion` transformation will still return a string, but you
    will be safe to `JSON.parse()` it.
</Warning>

### `regex`

This validates whether the LLM's response matches a regex. It will try to fix it if not. This requires a `pattern` property, in this format:

```ts
{
    pattern: "[a-z0-9]",
    flags: 'i'
} // equates to /[a-z0-9]/i
```
