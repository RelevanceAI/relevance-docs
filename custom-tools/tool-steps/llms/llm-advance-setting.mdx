There is a lot more to LLM that the prompt and the model.
Click on "Advanced options" on the LLM step and you can

* Add conversation history: to provide context and specify roles for a conversation with the LLM
* Add a system prompt: to provide information on who the LLM is or what role it plays and the general expectation
* Set parameters such as Temperature, validators and text preprocessing
* Choose the best way of handling large amount of data when you need to provide large context for the LLM to work

### Conversation history
Click on `+ Add row` and you can add lines of conversation taking place between a "user" and "ai".
<Info>
The only acceptable roles are "ai" and "user".
</Info>
Conversation history is useful in conversational agents and help AI to know more about the situation. Such a history
can make a more personalized experience as well. For example "Hello, my name is Sam" is likely to get a response such
as "Hello **Sam** - How can I help you?".

### System prompt
A system prompt is composed of notes, instruction and guides normally guiding AI to assume a certain role, 
or to follow a specific format, or limitations.
For instance `You are an expert on the solar system. Answer the following questions in a concise and informative manner`

### Strip line-breaks
This is a text pre-processing parameter. If set to `yes` all the new lines will be removed from the provided prompt.
This might be handy when the prompt is slightly larger than the context capacity of the selected model.

### Temperature
Temperature is a hyperparameter, ranging in (0,1), that affects the randomness (sometimes referred to as creativity) 
of the LLMs' response.
Higher randomness/creativity/diversity is expected of higher temperature values.
However, responses might also lose the right context.
