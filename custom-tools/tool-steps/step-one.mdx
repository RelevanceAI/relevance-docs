### Step configuration

1. Each step has a set of inputs, with some visible under "**Advanced options**". These inputs are used to configure the step. You can either specify the value or switch to variable mode by pressing "**{}**" next to each input. This will instead set the value to the variable you reference.
2. Each step will have a set of outputs. These are the values that will be passed on to the next step. You can configure the outputs by pressing "**Configure output**" and selecting the variable names you want to keep. 
3. Each step has a variable name is used to reference it in another step. For example, you can use `{{steps.step_name.output.variable_name}}` to reference it. It can be changed just like the inputs.
4. The order of a step can be changed using the drag indicator or the up and down buttons. Steps can be ran individually, which is helpful for testing, by pressing the play icon.
