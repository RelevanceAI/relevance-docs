Tool steps are analysis components that are applied to the provided input in a Tool.
For example,
* A LLM step to summarize an input text
* An PDF-to-Text step to extract the text from and uploaded PDF file
* A Javascript step to run a code snippet

Relevance support variety analysis steps with all the requirement all taken care of.
All you need to do is to add the suitable step component to your Tool.

Tips: 

1. Each step has a set of inputs, with some visible under "**Advanced options**". These inputs are used to configure the step. You can either specify the value or switch to variable mode by pressing "**{}**" next to each input. This will instead set the value to the variable you reference.
2. Each step will have a set of outputs. These are the values that will be passed on to the next step. You can configure the outputs by pressing "**Configure output**" and selecting the variable names you want to keep. 
3. Each step has a variable name, shown in green on the tool, which is used to reference the step and access the output in other steps. For example, you can use `{{steps.step_name.output.variable_name}}` to reference it. It can be changed just like the inputs.
4. The order of a step can be changed using the drag indicator or the up and down buttons. Steps can be ran individually, which is helpful for testing, by pressing the play icon.
