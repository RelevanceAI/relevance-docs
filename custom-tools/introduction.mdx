To build a Tool, click on `+ Create tool` located on top right of the Tools page.

At Relevance, you can use [ready-to-use templates](/templates/introduction) 
(i.e. Tools that are designed and maintained by Relevance) or 
[create your own Tool](/custom-tools/create-a-tool).

In the following subsections and pages, we will explain all required steps and all the
available components to create a Tool.

<Tip>
Tools that you design are saved under the [Tools](/get-started/key-concepts/tools.mdx) menu.
