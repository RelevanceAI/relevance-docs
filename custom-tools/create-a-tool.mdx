## Creating a chain

You can create a new chain by clicking "**New Chain +**" in the dashboard.

![Empty state of new chain](/images/new-chain.png)

You will be presented with an empty state where you can view some video tutorials, define some inputs or add your first step.

## Defining your first input

Every chain has inputs, they are used to pass data into the chain for execution. This will be presented as form for the app or as JSON params for the API.

Click on "**+ Text input**" to add a new input that accepts text. An input will now be created. Every input has a title, description, input and variable name.

<Tip>Description has support for limited markdown syntax such as bold, italics and URLs. Use this to make your inputs sparkle.</Tip>

Variables are used to reference the input in the chain. For example, if you want to use the input in a step, you can use the variable name as `{{params.text_variable}}`. It's recommended that you use relevance names so it's easier to reference the right ones.

## Adding your first step

Click on "**+ Generate text using LLMs**" to add your first LLM step. This will add a step to the chain that can generate text using an LLM like GPT based on inputs and settings you specify. 

![LLM step](/images/llm-step.png)

Get started by selecting the model to use, select GPT 3.5 (OpenAI).

Now we are ready to write our prompt. We can use the templating syntax to inject variables into the prompt from our inputs and previous steps. Add the following to the prompt:

```text
Create an engaging Instagram caption based on the following: "{{params.text_variable}}"
```

Write in the input variable: "AI is changing the way teams work". This will be used as the prompt for the LLM. Click the run icon on the LLM step and you will see the following output:

```text
ðŸš€ Embrace the future of teamwork! AI is revolutionizing the way teams collaborate, innovate, and achieve extraordinary results. Say goodbye to traditional work methods and hello to a whole new era of efficiency and creativity! ðŸ’¡âœ¨ #AIRevolution #TeamworkEvolved
```

## Adding a datasets

Adding a knowledgebase to your chain can make it much more effective. For example, if we provide past examples of the types of Instagram captions we make then we can make sure our new ones are in the same style and tone.




### Step configuration

1. Each step has a set of inputs, with some visible under "**Advanced options**". These inputs are used to configure the step. You can either specify the value or switch to variable mode by pressing "**{}**" next to each input. This will instead set the value to the variable you reference.
2. Each step will have a set of outputs. These are the values that will be passed on to the next step. You can configure the outputs by pressing "**Configure output**" and selecting the variable names you want to keep. 
3. Each step has a variable name is used to reference it in another step. For example, you can use `{{steps.step_name.output.variable_name}}` to reference it. It can be changed just like the inputs.
4. The order of a step can be changed using the drag indicator or the up and down buttons. Steps can be ran individually, which is helpful for testing, by pressing the play icon.
