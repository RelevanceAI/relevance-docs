Every Tool can be applied to single entries (i.e. [Single run](/custom-tools/single-run)) or on all entries in a dataset (i.e. Bulk run).
Single run helps you understand the Tool, its input and output and credit cost. Therefore, it is recommended to use the 
[Single run](/templates/single-run) option first before a [Bulk run].

On this page, we will explain different ways of accessing Bulk run for a Tool.
