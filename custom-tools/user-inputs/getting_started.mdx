For almost all analysis tools, we need some input. Such inputs full-fill different purposes.
For example,
* Setting and instruction (e.g. maximum number of X to extract, instruction for formatting the output)
* Actual data to analyze (e.g. a CSV file)
* A question to answer 

Relevance support variety of input types with all the requirement all taken care of.
All you need to do is to add the suitable user input component to your Tool.

## Creating a Tool and adding user inputs

The easiest way to get started with creating a tool is to start at the 
[Tools page](/get-started/key-concepts/tools).
Once on the page, click on `+ Create tool` on the top right of the page.

You will be presented with an empty state where you can:

1. add knowledge
2. **add inputs**
3. add tool steps
4. access some video tutorials

In the next pages, we will learn about all the supported user inputs on Relevance.

<Tip>
1. All user input components accept a name and a description. Description supports limited markdown syntax 
such as bold, italics and URLs. Use this to make your inputs sparkle

2. Variables are used to reference use inputs in Tools. Variable names are shown in green and can be used 
with `{{}}` to access the input values. For example, if you want to use text value in a text input which is 
named `my_text_input`, you can use the variable name as `{{my_text_input}}`

3. Inputs are presented as form for the
[App page](/templates/introduction#app-try-the-tool-on-a-play-ground) and as JSON params
for the [API](/templates/introduction#api)
