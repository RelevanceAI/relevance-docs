<Tip>
Inputs are presented as form for the
[APP page](/templates/introduction#app-try-the-tool-on-a-play-ground) and as JSON params
for the [API](/templates/introduction#api).
</Tip>

<Tip>Description has support for limited markdown syntax such as bold, italics and URLs. 
Use this to make your inputs sparkle.</Tip>

Variables are used to reference the input in the chain. For example, if you want to use 
the input in a step, you can use the variable name as `{{params.text_variable}}`. 
It's recommended that you use relevance names so it's easier to reference the right ones.
