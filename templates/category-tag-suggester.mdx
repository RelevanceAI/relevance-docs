One of the frequently used templates at Relevance is Category/Tag suggester.
This Tool analyses a subset of a CSV file and provides you with suggestions
on existing categories (i.e. themes/topics) in the data. 
These categories can be later used for 
[text categorization](/templates/text-categorizer-classifier).

<Snippet file="how-to-use-a-tool.mdx" />

### Tool inputs and output
The Tool requires three main and four optional inputs: 
1. A CSV file (CSV)
2. The name of the target column (Target column: Column containing the text for categorization):
3. Row numbers of the target subset (Rows to look at)
Provide the main inputs and hit `Run once`, you will see the LLM response in a few seconds
similar to what is shown in the image below. You can use the copy button or select the text to
copy for the next step.

<Tip>
* Use the Category/Tag suggester Tool on different subsets of your file (i.e. multiple runs 
for different ranges of rows). Copy the suggestions to a text file and finalize the category 
suggestion list by applying your domain knowledge considering the 
[next step](/templates/text-categorizer-classifier) requirements.
* LLMs have limited capacity for receiving input data. Instead of using your whole file
(i.e. first row to the last row) use subsets of the file to analyze the data for category
suggestions.
</Tip>

4. Maximum preferred word count per categories/themes/topics: 
An optional input, set to 3 by default, indicating how wordy suggested categories could be. 
Note that it is about the number of words in each suggested category/topic and not the 
total number of suggestions.
5. Maximum number of categories/themes/topic to extract:
An optional input, set to 10 by default, indicating the expected number of category/topic suggestions.
6. Objective:
An optional input, set to `General` by default, indicating the objective for extracting categories.
In other words indicating a lense through which the data is analyzed.
7. Example (Example(s) of category/theme/topic extraction done by you):
LLMs are proven to work better when they see samples. Provide sample(s) of your text data and the 
categories you would annotate for the samples.
<Tip>
* Using `,` you can provide multiple categories per sample
* Keep the writing style uniform (e.g.Capital each word)
</Tip>

The output is a list of suggested categories.

### User inputs
![User inputs](/images/templates/category-tag-suggester/category-tag-suggester-build-input.png)

1. <Snippet file="components/inputs/file-to-url.mdx" />

2. <Snippet file="components/inputs/text-input.mdx" />
    This component is used twice in this Tool. Target column and the objective are both of Text
    inputs.

3. <Snippet file="components/inputs/table.mdx" />
    This component is used twice in this Tool. Row range (from - to) and well as Examples
    (Text - Categories/topics) are both samples of structured input data.

4. <Snippet file="components/inputs/numeric-input.mdx" />
    This component is used twice in this Tool. Both maximum word count per category and maximum
    number of suggested categories are of numeric inputs.

### Tool steps
There are 4 components under the Tool steps in this analysis flow. These components take care of three
tasks: loading the specified subset of the file, properly formatting the provided samples,
and the LLM step.

#### Loading the specified subset of the file
1. Loading the file into readable json format
![CSV to JSON](/images/templates/category-tag-suggester/category-tag-suggester-build-csv-to-json.png)
<Snippet file="components/tools/convert-spreadsheet-to-json.mdx" />

2. Selecting the specified subset of the data
![code](/images/templates/category-tag-suggester/category-tag-suggester-build-subset.png)
<Snippet file="components/tools/code-python.mdx" />
    In this case, the Python code, filters out any rows that is not in the specified range.

#### Properly formatting the provided samples
![code](/images/templates/category-tag-suggester/category-tag-suggester-build-sample.png)
<Snippet file="components/tools/code-python.mdx" />
    In this case, the Python code, forms the entered samples in the format that is suitable
    abd compatible to the prompt.

#### Large Language Model (LLM)
![LLM](/images/templates/category-tag-suggester/category-tag-suggester-build-llm.png)
<Snippet file="components/tools/llm.mdx" />

**[A Good Prompt](/llms/prompt)**
1. Be short and precise with your instruction/request from the LLM
2. Explicitly note constraints and goals
3. Include formatting instruction when necessary
