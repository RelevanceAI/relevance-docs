<Tip>LLMs are not designed or trained for statistical analysis. Questions like 
"How many projects were conducted?" or "What was the overall success on the x projects?" 
are likely to raise the "I could not find the answer" response unless there is a note in 
the provided information stating the answer.</Tip>

## Tool components

[make a tool from scratch](/notebook/introduction), 
you will have access to the Build tab.

their needs.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Split text">
![website](/images/templates/gpt-on-my-website/GPT-on-my-website-splittext.png)
When scraping a website, the whole content is loaded as a big chunk of text. However, 
in use-cases such as question answering, it is unlikely that the whole content
is the answer to a given question.
Therefore, it is highly recommended to break the content into smaller chunks (i.e. 
text splitting).
[Split text](/custom-tools/tool-steps/split-text) in this tool breaks the website content
to chunks of 500 tokens.

Vectors are representation of data in vector space (i.e. a numeric representation 
in which items that are semantically close to each other are located close to 
one another as well).
[Vectorize and search](/custom-tools/tool-steps/vectorize-and-search) takes the source
data and a query (the website content and question respectively in this tool), vectorizes
the data and query and returns the most relevance piece in the data source as the answer 
to the query.
