<Tip>LLMs are not designed or trained for statistical analysis. Questions like 
"How many projects were conducted?" or "What was the overall success on the x projects?" 
are likely to raise the "I could not find the answer" response unless there is a note in 
the provided information stating the answer.</Tip>

The output is the answer to the question based on the provided information.
