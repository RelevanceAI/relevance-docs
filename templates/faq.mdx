### How long my bulk run can take?
Under current setup, each run gets terminated after 4 hours. If your data table is large and 4 hours does not cover all the rows,
you can rerun your enrichment using the "Run on rows that haven't run" option. "Run on rows that haven't run" resumes the execution 
from where it stopped.

### How do I access the bulk-run analysis results?
Each output variable iof your AI Tool will be added to your data table as a new column.
You can see the results on the data table or [export](/templates/export) to a CSV.

### Can an AI Tool have multiple outputs?
Yes!
You can configure multiple outputs for your AI Tool. Each output will have its corresponding column in the data table.

### Can I run a Tool multiple times on a data table?
Yes!
There is no limitation on the number of times you run a Tool. Just keep in mind that to avoid overwriting the existing results, you
should name the output colum for each run.

### If my dataset contains more than one column to be analyzed, do I need to upload the dataset multiple times?
No!
There is no limitation on the number of times you run a Tool. You can use the same data table while configure the bulk run, as many
times as needed.
Just keep in mind that to avoid overwriting the existing results, you should name the output colum for each run.

### Can I leave the page after starting a bulk-run?
Yes!
Bulk AI-powered data enrichment (i.e. bulk-run) is executed in the background. So rows of data will be added to your dataset even
if you leave or refresh the page.

### Is there a cap on the number of rows AI Tools can process?
Technically, no - however, you will be limited by the number of credits you have.

### What format is supported for the data table?
The enhancement of your dataset executes across a dataset, which can be created from CSVs and Excel files or from files 
such as PDFs, audio and Word which are automatically converted into a dataset.

### How does bulk run (enrichment) pricing work?
Bulk runs are charged the same as individual triggers of a chain. Each row in your dataset will be the equivalent of one execution 
of the chain (for example 2 credits per row).

### How is credits consumption calculated?
Credit consumption at Relevance is similar to directly using any of the models. Factors such as the used models or number of tokes contribute
to the consumed credit.

### What if I exceed the credit limit for my plan?
Depending on what plan you are on, you might need to top up before further using the platform or have a buffer when your credits are negative but can 
still use the platform before topping up.

### Will there be a price difference between using GPT 3.5 VS GPT4 or other models?
Models have different features!
Regarding GPT 4 and GPT 3.5, the former is 15 to 20 times more expensive than the latter.

### Can I use my own API key?
Absolutely!
Set up your own keys at the [API key](/get-started/key-concepts/api-keys) page.
