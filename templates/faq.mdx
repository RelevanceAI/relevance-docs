### How long my bulk run can take?
Under current setup, each run gets terminated after 4 hours. If your data table is large and 4 hours does not cover all the rows,
you can rerun your enrichment using the "Run on rows that haven't run" option. "Run on rows that haven't run" resumes the execution 
from where it stopped.
