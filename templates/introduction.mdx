One of the missions at Relevance is to design and maintain tools that can be widely beneficial
across different use-cases. Such tools are available under Templates.
![Home page](/images/templates/templates-page.png)

Tools under templates are categorized based on their most frequent use-case. You can scroll on the page 
or directly go to any of the below categories:
* Featured
* Operations
* Marketing
* Research
* Sales
* Other

## Key concepts
### APP: Try the tool on a play-ground
Locate the desired tool and click on `Use template`. This will open the tool APP page.
APP is where you provide the required information and try the tool on samples of your data. 

### Run in Bulk: Apply a tool to your whole dataset
As the name suggests, Bulk run is to apply the analysis on many data entries. For instance, 
* a dataset of research findings and applying a summarization tool on every single entry
* a dataset of survey responses and applying a tagging/coding tool on every single response

To apply bulk run, you need to provide the dataset (uploading a file or using an existing dataset).
Then specify which of the tool input(s) must get loaded from the provided dataset and enter the 
other inputs on the form as done on APP.

### Clone a template: Create a copy of a tool in your account
Cloning makes a copy of the desired template in your account and you will have full permission to modify them
to better suit your needs.

### Build a tool
Tools are super flexible and at Relevance we aim at 

### Share a tool
When building a tool, as the owner of the tool, you have full control on how you want it to be shared with 
your colleagues or teammates.
When clicked on `Share` you can use
* Sharable link: permission to use
* Template link: permission to use and modify

### API
You can integrate the tool into your website. All the required information is available under API
