description: 'Templates are ready to use Chains designed and maintained by Relevance'

One of the missions at Relevance is to design and maintain Chains that can be widely beneficial
across different use-cases. Such chains are available under Templates.
![Home page](/images/templates/templates-page.png)

Chains under templates are categorized based on their most frequent use-case. You can scroll on the page 
or directly go to any of the below categories:
* Featured
* Operations
* Marketing
* Research
* Sales
* Other

## Key concepts
### APP: Try the chain on a play-ground
Locate the desired chain and click on `Use template`. This will open the chain APP page.
APP is where you provide the required information and try the chain on samples of your data. 

### Run in Bulk: Apply a chain to your whole dataset
As the name suggests, Bulk run is to apply the analysis on many data entries. For instance, 
* a dataset of research findings and applying a summarization chain on every single entry
* a dataset of survey responses and applying a tagging/coding chain on every single response

To apply bulk run, you need to provide the dataset (uploading a file or using an existing dataset).
Then specify which of the chain input(s) must get loaded from the provided dataset and enter the 
other inputs on the form as done on APP.

### Clone a template: Create a copy of a chain in your account
Cloning makes a copy of the desired template in your account and you will have full permission to modify them
to better suit your needs.

### Build a chain
Chains are super flexible and at Relevance we aim at 

### Share a chain
When building a chain, as the owner of the chain, you have full control on how you want it to be shared with 
your colleagues or teammates.
When clicked on `Share` you can use
* Sharable link: permission to use
* Template link: permission to use and modify

### API
You can integrate the chain into your website. All the required information is available under API
