    "How many projects were conducted?" or "What was the overall success on the x projects?" 
    are likely to raise the "I could not find the answer" response unless there is a note in 
    the provided information stating the answer.
    </Tip>

the run options on your data table (bulk/single run) to initiate the the analysis process. The Tool will process the file and generate 
a response based on the content and context of the file.
