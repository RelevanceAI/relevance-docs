Sentiment analysis is the task of identifying the overall polarity of a piece of text and classifying it as 
Positive, Negative or Neutral.
Relevance AI's Sentiment analysis Template receives an input text and produces categorize it into one of the
three sentiment classes.

<Note>
This tool does not break the input text into its composing sentences. The assigned label is the **overall**
sentiment.
Therefore, if the input is composed of multiple sentences, some positive (e.g. She is truly excited) and
some negative (e.g. but she was not successful last time) the overall sentiment is likely to be Neutral.
