### Tool inputs and output
The tool requires two inputs: 
1. A PDF file (PDF)
2. A list of topics to extract (Data to extract):
Provide the input data and hit `Run once`, you will see the LLM response in a few seconds
similar to what is shown in the image below. Simply click on the Export button on the bottom

<Tip>LLMs are not designed or trained for statistical analysis. Hence, it is recommended
to ask for topics or subjects that are clearly mentioned in the text.</Tip>

The output is a CSV with columns representing the extracted data.

### Tool steps
There are 5 components under the Tool steps in this tool. These components take care of three
tasks: converting PDF to text, the LLM step, and formatting for CSV export.

#### Converting PDF to text
![code](/images/templates/extract-data-from-pdf/extract-data-from-pdf-convert-pdf-to-text.png)
[A text to PDF component](/custom-tools/tool-steps/convert-pdf-to-text) is available which 
receives a file URL and extract the text from it. This component supports OCR.

#### Large Language Model (LLM)

<Snippet file="components/tools/llm.mdx" />

**[A Good Prompt](/llms/prompt)**
1. Be short and precise with your instruction/request from the LLM
2. Include formatting instruction when necessary

#### Formatting for CSV export
1. Markdown to CSV
![code](/images/templates/extract-data-from-pdf/extract-data-from-pdf-build-code1.png)
<Snippet file="components/tools/code-javascript.mdx" />
    In this tool, the code-snippet turns the Markdown format
to a CSV.

2. A temporary downloadable file
![export](/images/templates/extract-data-from-pdf/extract-data-from-pdf-build-export1.png)
When the output is generated, it needs to be turned into a downloadable file. At Relevance
this can be easily done via a ready-to-use component.
[Export to a temporary file](/custom-tools/tool-steps/export-data-to-a-temporary-downloadable-file)
takes the data (the extracted content from the source PDF in this tool), exports it to a
downloadable CSV and returns a URL to access the file.

3. Export to CSV
![code](/images/templates/extract-data-from-pdf/extract-data-from-pdf-build-code2.png)
[A Javascript code component](/custom-tools/tool-steps/code-javascript) is available to Run
Javascript codes when necessary. In this tool, the second code-snippet simply returns the
downloadable URL to the output file.
