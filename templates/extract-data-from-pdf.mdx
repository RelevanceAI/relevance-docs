you access to GPT (and many other LLMs). 
In the prompt section, you will provide the required information as well as instructions to what 
is expected to be done.

**[A Good Prompt](/llms/prompt)**

When the output is generated, it needs to be turned into a downloadable file. At Relevance
this can be easily done via a ready-to-use component.

downloadable CSV and returns a URL to access the file.

3. Export to CSV

[A Javascript code component](/custom-tools/tool-steps/code-javascript) is available to Run
Javascript codes when necessary. In this tool, the second code-snippet simply returns the
downloadable URL to the output file.
