### Tool steps
There are 5 components under the Tool steps in this analysis flow. These components take care of three
tasks: converting PDF to text, the LLM step, and formatting for CSV export.

#### Converting PDF to text
![code](/images/templates/extract-data-from-pdf/extract-data-from-pdf-convert-pdf-to-text.png)
    <Snippet file="components/tools/pdf-to-text.mdx" />

#### Large Language Model (LLM)

    <Snippet file="components/tools/llm.mdx" />

    <Snippet file="a-good-prompt.mdx" />
    1. Be short and precise with your instruction/request from the LLM
    2. Include formatting instruction when necessary
    3. Specify the scope using `"`, `"""` or similar identifiers

#### Formatting for CSV export
1. Markdown to CSV
