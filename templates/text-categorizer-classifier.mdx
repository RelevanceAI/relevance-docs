One of the frequently used templates at Relevance is Categorize text.
This Tool receives a list of predefined categories/themes/topics and a dataset composed
of at least one column containing text values such as reviews.
The Tool goes through the data and categorizes each text value to the matching 
categories/themes/topics from the provided list.

<Tip>
You can bring your own list of categories/themes/topics (BYO) or use 
[Suggest category Tool](/templates/category-tag-suggester) as the first step of text categorization flow.

### Tool inputs and output
The Tool requires three main and one optional inputs: 
1. Text to categorize
2. List of categories/themes/topics: To be entered as a one category per line
3. Maximum number of expected categories per input text
Provide the main inputs and hit `Run once`, you will see the LLM response in a few seconds
similar to what is shown in the image below.

4. Example (Example(s) of categorization done by you):
LLMs are proven to work better when they see samples. Provide sample(s) of your text data and how you would
categorize it **using items from the list that you entered in the second input**. Use `,` when multiple 
categories/themes/topics apply.

<Tip>
**Good Categories**

1. Clear: AI is not an expert in your domain. Keep the categories simple and clear as if you are helping an intern.
2. Unbiased: Even though AI understands sentiment, it is better to keep the categories neutral (Service vs Good service)
3. Use `/` to combine two relevant categories (e.g. Customer Service / Support)
4. Avoid including overlapping categories
</Tip>

The output is a list of categories assigned to the input. 

### Tool execution
<Snippet file="tool-execution.mdx" />

<Snippet file="components/tools/tool-components.mdx" />

### User inputs
![User inputs](/images/templates/text-categorizer-classifier/text-categorizer-classifier-build-input.png)

1. <Snippet file="components/inputs/long-text-input.mdx" />
    This component is used twice in this Tool. Both input text (Text to categorize) and 
    the list of categories (List of categories) are of long tex inputs.

2. <Snippet file="components/inputs/numeric-input.mdx" />
    Use the default value (3) or enter your preferred maximum number of categories to be assigned to each input.

3. <Snippet file="components/inputs/table.mdx" />
    This component allows you to provide samples of text categorization done by you.
    * Enter the input sample under "text"
    * Enter matching categories under "topics"
    * Use categories/themes/topics from the list you provided with the exact same spelling
    * Use `,` when multiple categories/themes/topics apply

### Tool steps
There are 4 components under the Tool steps in this analysis flow. These components take care of three
tasks: properly formatting the provided categories/themes/topics, the LLM step and formatting the output.

#### Properly formatting the provided categories/themes/topics
    String to List formatting
    ![code](/images/templates/text-categorizer-classifier/text-categorizer-classifier-build-code1.png)
    <Snippet file="components/tools/code-python.mdx" />
        In this case, the Python code, filters out empty lines and creates a list of 
        categories/themes/topics from the provided text.

#### Large Language Model (LLM)
    ![LLM](/images/templates/text-categorizer-classifier/text-categorizer-classifier-build-llm.png)
    <Snippet file="components/tools/llm.mdx" />

    **[A Good Prompt](/custom-tools/tool-steps/llms/prompt)**
    1. Be short and precise with your instruction/request from the LLM
    2. Stick to one term when referring to the same concept throughout the prompt
    3. Note the goals and important instructions closes possible to the end of the prompt
    4. Explicitly note constraints and goals
    5. Specify a data scope using `"`, `"""` or similar identifiers
    6. Include formatting instruction when necessary


#### Properly formatting the output
1. <Snippet file="components/tools/convert-string-to-json.mdx" />
   ![code](/images/templates/text-categorizer-classifier/text-categorizer-classifier-build-str-to-json.png)
   This is to make sure we can properly save the results in the desired structure.
   

2. Filtering out unwanted categories/themes/topics
    ![code](/images/templates/text-categorizer-classifier/text-categorizer-classifier-build-code2.png)
    <Snippet file="components/tools/code-python.mdx" />
    Occasionally the LLM might output categories/themes/topics that are not in the pre-specified list.
    This is taken care of using a simple Python code snippet in this Tool.
