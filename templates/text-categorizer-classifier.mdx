### Tool inputs and output
The tool requires two inputs: 
1. URL to a website to look at (Website)
2. A question to answer (Question): 
Provide the input data and hit `Run once`, you will see the LLM response in a few seconds
similar to what is shown in the image below.

<Tip>LLMs are not designed or trained for statistical analysis. Questions like 
"How many projects were conducted?" or "What was the overall success on the x projects?" 
are likely to raise the "I could not find the answer" response unless there is a note in 
the provided information stating the answer.</Tip>

The output is the answer to the question based on the provided information.

### User inputs
![User inputs](/images/templates/text-categorizer-classifier/text-categorizer-classifier-build-input.png)

Both inputs in this tool are of Text input. The first one is to provide a URL and the second
one to enter a question.
**[Text input](/custom-tools/user-inputs/text-input)**: An input text component suitable for short 
text pieces, such as entering a question.

### Tool steps
There are 5 components under the Tool steps in this tool. These components take care of three
tasks: extracting the website content, preparing the data for search, and the LLM step.

#### Extract the website Content
1. URL control
![code](/images/templates/text-categorizer-classifier/text-categorizer-classifier-code.png)
[A Javascript code component](/custom-tools/tool-steps/code-javascript) is available to Run
Javascript codes when necessary. In this tool, the code-snippet checks the URL format.

2. Scrape the website
![website](/images/templates/text-categorizer-classifier/text-categorizer-classifier-website-content.png)
[Extract Website Content](/custom-tools/tool-steps/extract-website-content) is a ready-to-use
component for scraping website contents. All that is needed a a URL to a website which
allows scraping.

#### Data preparation and vector search
1. Split text
![website](/images/templates/text-categorizer-classifier/text-categorizer-classifier-splittext.png)
When scraping a website, the whole content is loaded as a big chunk of text. However, 
in use-cases such as question answering, it is unlikely that the whole content
is the answer to a given question.
Therefore, it is highly recommended to break the content into smaller chunks (i.e. 
text splitting).
[Split text](/custom-tools/tool-steps/split-text) in this tool breaks the website content
to chunks of 500 tokens.

2. Vectorize and search array
![website](/images/templates/text-categorizer-classifier/text-categorizer-classifier-vectorize.png)
Vectors are representation of data in vector space (i.e. a numeric representation 
in which items that are semantically close to each other are located close to 
one another as well).
[Vectorize and search](/custom-tools/tool-steps/vectorize-and-search) takes the source
data and a query (the website content and question respectively in this tool), vectorizes
the data and query and returns the most relevance piece in the data source as the answer 
to the query.

#### Large Language Model (LLM)
![LLM](/images/templates/text-categorizer-classifier/text-categorizer-classifier-build-llm.png)
[A large language model component](/custom-tools/tool-steps/llm) is all set up to provide 
you access to GPT (and many other LLMs). 
In the prompt section, you will provide the required information as well as instructions to what 
is expected to be done.

**[A Good Prompt](/llms/prompt)**
1. Provide the context at the top
2. Be short and precise with your instruction/request from the LLM
3. Note what you expect instead of noting what you don't want
