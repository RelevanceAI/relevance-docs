Relevance AI gives you a set of builders to create and configure the different parts of your AI workforce. Whether you're building a single agent or an entire team, everything starts here.

## How It All Fits Together

**Tools** are the building blocks — they define the actions and automations your agents can perform, like searching a CRM, sending an email, or running a custom workflow. **Agents** use those tools to autonomously complete tasks, following the instructions and guardrails you set. **Workforces** connect multiple agents together, letting them collaborate and hand off work to each other on a visual canvas. **Knowledge** gives your agents access to specific data sources — documents, spreadsheets, databases — so they have the context they need to do their job well.

## Inside a Builder

Here's an example of what a builder looks like — in this case, the Agent Builder:

Each builder looks a bit different, but they all utilise the same concepts. The docs throughout this tab cover all the features available across each builder and how to configure them.

## Building Options

When creating agents and tools, you have two approaches. **Invent** lets you describe what you want in plain language and the platform generates it for you — great for getting started quickly. **Manual** gives you full step-by-step control over every setting and configuration, ideal when you need precision or want to fine-tune behavior.

## What's Next?

A good starting point is to build your first agent — head to the [Agent Builder](/agent/build-your-agent/build-overview) to get going. From there, you can create [custom tools](/tool/create-a-tool) for it to use, add [knowledge](/knowledge/create-knowledge) to give it context, and eventually connect multiple agents into a [workforce](/workforce/build-an-ai-workforce/add-triggers) as your needs grow.
