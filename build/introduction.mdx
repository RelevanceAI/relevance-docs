Relevance AI has two main experiences — the builder platform for creating, and Chat for using.

The **[builder platform](https://app.relevanceai.com)** is where you create and configure everything — agents, tools, workforces, and knowledge. You'll also find the [Marketplace](/marketplace/intro-to-marketplace) here, where you can clone pre-built agents and tools instead of starting from scratch. This section of the docs covers the builder platform and all of its features.

**[Relevance Chat](/chat/intro-to-chat)** is a conversational interface where you and your team interact with your agents directly. You can @ mention agents, use multiple agents in a single conversation, and give your team access to your agents — all through a familiar chat experience.

This section focuses on building. To learn more about Chat, head to the [Relevance Chat](/chat/intro-to-chat) page in Getting Started.

## How it all fits together

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tools — the actions" icon="screwdriver-wrench">
    You build [tools](/tool/customize-tool/tool-style-guide) that define what your agents can do — call an API, send an email, search your CRM, run custom code, or chain steps together into a workflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Knowledge — the context" icon="brain">
    You connect [knowledge](/knowledge/create-knowledge) so agents have access to your data — documents, spreadsheets, databases, websites — and can respond with accuracy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agents — the workers" icon="robot">
    You create [agents](/agent/build-your-agent/prompt) that use your tools and knowledge to autonomously complete tasks, following the instructions and guardrails you set.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Workforces — the team" icon="users-gear">
    You connect multiple agents into a [workforce](/workforce/build-an-ai-workforce/add-triggers) on a visual canvas — they collaborate and hand off work to each other.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Ways to create

When creating agents and tools, you have two approaches:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Invent" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Describe what you want in plain language and the platform generates it for you. Invent sets up the prompt, suggests tools, and gets you a working agent or tool fast — you make the tweaks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Build from scratch" icon="hammer">
    Full step-by-step control over every setting and configuration. Ideal when you need precision, have a specific workflow in mind, or want to fine-tune behavior.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What's next?

If you want to dive into the specifics of how to build and configure each component, the rest of this section covers everything. Start with [building an agent's prompt](/agent/build-your-agent/prompt), then explore how to create [custom tools](/tool/customize-tool/tool-style-guide), connect [knowledge sources](/knowledge/create-knowledge), and wire it all together in a [workforce](/workforce/build-an-ai-workforce/add-triggers).
