### About your company

## Changing your profile picture

Your profile picture appears throughout Relevance AI when you interact with agents, collaborate with team members, and across the platform. How you update your profile picture depends on how you signed up for Relevance AI.

### For Google sign-in users

If you signed up using Google authentication, your profile picture comes from your Google account. To change it, update your Google profile picture and it will automatically sync to Relevance AI.

### For Enterprise users with SSO enforced

If you're an Enterprise user and your organization has enforced Single Sign-On (SSO), your profile picture comes from your organization's identity provider. To change it, update your profile picture in your organization's identity management system.

### For all other users (Gravatar)

If you signed up with an email and password, you can set your profile picture using [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com).

<Note>
  **What is Gravatar?** Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar) is a free service that allows you to use a single profile picture across multiple websites and platforms. Once you set up your Gravatar profile with your email address, any website that supports Gravatar will automatically display your chosen picture.
</Note>

#### Setting up your Gravatar profile picture

<Warning>
  Your Gravatar email address must match your Relevance AI account email address. You can check your current email address on the Security page in your Profile settings. If needed, [change your email address](/get-started/account-management/change-email-address) to match your Gravatar account.
