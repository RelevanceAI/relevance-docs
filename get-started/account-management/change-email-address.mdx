## Who cannot change their email

Some users are unable to change their email address through this process:

### Google sign-in users

If you signed up for Relevance AI using Google authentication (Sign in with Google), you cannot change your email address through this method at this time. This capability may be added in the future.

    1. Create a new account with your new email address at https://app.relevanceai.com/auth
    2. After successfully creating a new account with your new email address, log back into your old account and add this account to all of your project(s)
    3. Reach out to our support team to delete your old account and change your billing details to reflect your new email if you have a subscription. You can learn how to reach out to our support team [here](https://relevanceai.com/docs/get-started/support)

### Enterprise users with SSO enforced

If you are an Enterprise user and your organization's administrator has enforced Single Sign-On (SSO), you cannot change your email address through this method. Contact your organization's administrator for assistance with email address changes. SSO enforcement is only available to Enterprise customers.
