At this time, there is no way to change your Relevance AI account email address.

Instead, we recommend using the following workaround\!

1. Create a new account with your new email address / the email address you want to change to at https://app.relevanceai.com/auth
2. After successfully creating a new account with your new email address, log back into your old account and add this account to all of your project(s)

After you've done this, you can reach out to our support team to delete your old account, and change your billing details to reflect your new email if you have a subscription. You can learn how to reach out to our support team [here](https://relevanceai.com/docs/get-started/support)

<Note>
  Adding the ability to change your account's email address is on our roadmap\!
