## Who cannot change their password

Some users are unable to change their password through this method:

### Google sign-in users

If you signed up for Relevance AI using Google authentication (Sign in with Google), you cannot change your password through this method as your password is managed by Google.

### Enterprise users with SSO enforced

If you are an Enterprise user and your organization's administrator has enforced Single Sign-On (SSO), you cannot change your password through this method. Your password is managed by your organization's identity provider. Contact your organization's administrator for assistance with password changes. SSO enforcement is only available to Enterprise customers.
