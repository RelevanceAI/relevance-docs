At this time, the only way to delete your Relevance AI account is to reach out to our support team to request your account deletion.

You can learn how to contact our support team at [here](https://relevanceai.com/docs/get-started/support).

Once your request is processed by our team, your account will be deleted in 30 days. 

<Note>Adding the ability to self-serve account deletion is on our roadmap!</Note>
