If you are an admin of your organization, or the project you wish to delete, you can delete a project by following this tutorial:

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmfc1dvf278eq39oz5vtnw7iv" frameBorder="0" title="Invite a user to a project in Relevance AI" allow="clipboard-write" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

1. Click 'Settings' in the sidebar
2. Click 'Projects'
3. Open the Project you want to delete
4. Click the three dots button, then click 'Delete'
5. On the pop-up that opens, click 'Delete Project'
6. On the next screen, type in the name of your project then click 'Delete Project' again to confirm its deletion

After that, you'll be directed to a pop-up showing that your project deletion is processing. You can navigate away from this screen if you wish. 

<Warning>Project deletion is **permanent**. If you delete a project, you will lose all of the assets inside of it (Agents, Tools, Workforces, Knowledge, etc.). If you delete a project, our team cannot recover it for you.</Warning>
