### User roles

Members in your organization can be assigned the following roles: Admin, Editor and Viewer. These roles determine what they can do inside of the platform, and what they can do when using the API.

## Add members to your Organization

<Warning>Your region choice is permanent and cannot be changed after your organization is created. If you need to change regions, [contact support](/get-started/support) to discuss your options. Learn more about [organization regions](/get-started/project-management/ids#organization-region).</Warning>

Once you've added someone to one of the projects in your organization, this will add them to the organization itself.

<Note>You cannot add someone to your Organization without adding them to one of your projects.</Note>

Once you've added someone to your organization, you can promote them to an admin of your Organization by going into Settings, clicking 'Organization' in the left-side panel, and then changing their organization role.

## Accepting a project invitation

When you're invited to a project, you'll receive an email with an invitation link. Here's how the acceptance process works:

### From an email invitation

1. **Click the invitation link** in your email. The link will look like: `https://app.relevanceai.com/invite/accept/{region}/{project}/{inviteCode}`

2. **Authenticate** if you're not already logged in. You'll see a loading screen that says "Processing your project invite..."

3. **Automatic acceptance** based on your account status:
   - **New user:** You'll be redirected to complete the onboarding process. Once you finish signing up, the invitation will be automatically accepted and you'll have access to the project.
   - **Already in the project:** You'll be redirected directly to the project dashboard. No further action is needed.
   - **Existing user, not in the project:** The system will automatically process your invitation and grant you access to the project.

<Tip>
Can't see the agents after being added to a project? You might need to [switch to the correct project](/get-started/project-management/switch-projects).
</Tip>

### Already in the same organization

If you're already a member of the same organization as the project, you may be automatically added to the project without receiving an email invitation. In this case, you can access the project immediately by [switching to the project](/get-started/project-management/switch-projects).

<Note>
When you accept a project invitation, you're also automatically added to the organization that owns the project.
