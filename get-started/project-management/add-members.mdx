## Accepting project invites

When someone invites you to join their project, you'll receive an email invitation. Follow these steps to accept the invite and join the project:

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative",paddingTop:"56.25%"}}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cm6n6mh4j00001" frameBorder="0" title="Accept a project invite in Relevance AI" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

1. Check your email for the project invitation from Relevance AI.
2. Click the invitation link in the email to open the project.
3. If you don't already have a Relevance AI account, you'll be prompted to create one.
4. Once logged in, you'll automatically be added to the project with the role assigned by the project admin.

<Tip>
After accepting an invite, you can [switch between projects](/get-started/project-management/switch-projects) at any time using the project switcher.

## Add members to your Organization

<Warning>Your region choice is permanent and cannot be changed after your organization is created. If you need to change regions, [contact support](/get-started/support) to discuss your options. Learn more about [organization regions](/get-started/project-management/ids#organization-region).</Warning>

Once you've added someone to one of the projects in your organization, this will add them to the organization itself.

<Note>You cannot add someone to your Organization without adding them to one of your projects.</Note>

Once you've added someone to your organization, you can promote them to an admin of your Organization by going into Settings, clicking 'Organization' in the left-side panel, and then changing their organization role.
