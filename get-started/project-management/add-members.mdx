## Add members to your Organization

<Warning>Your region choice is permanent and cannot be changed after your organization is created. If you need to change regions, [contact support](/get-started/support) to discuss your options. Learn more about [organization regions](/get-started/project-management/ids#organization-region).</Warning>

Once you've added someone to one of the projects in your organization, this will add them to the organization itself.

<Note>You cannot add someone to your Organization without adding them to one of your projects.</Note>

Once you've added someone to your organization, you can promote them to an admin of your Organization by going into Settings, clicking 'Organization' in the left-side panel, and then changing their organization role.
