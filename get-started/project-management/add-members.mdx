## Add members to your project

Once you've [signed-up](http://app.relevanceai.com/) and created a Relevance account, you can add other members to your projects. 

1. Go to Relevance AI and click **[Sign Up](http://app.relevanceai.com/)**.
2. Enter your email and password to create an account, or sign up with your Google account.
3. Follow the sign-up wizard, which includes choosing the [region you want to store you data](https://relevanceai.com/docs/security#regions) in.
4. Click on `Settings` in the hamburger menu.
5. In **Projects**, select the default project, or create a new one for your team.
6. Click on `+ Invite user` and enter the email of the member you want to add to your organisation.
7. Send invite!

Here's a quick demo of how you create an account and invite team members:

    width: '100%',
    position: 'relative',
    paddingTop: '56.25%',
  }}>
  <iframe

    frameBorder="0"
    title="Invite a user to a project in Relevance AI"
    allow="clipboard-write"
    webkitallowfullscreen="true"
    mozallowfullscreen="true"
    allowfullscreen
    style={{

      top: 0,left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%',
      border: '3px solid #5E43CE',
      borderRadius: '10px',
    }}/>

### User roles

Members in your organisation can be assigned the following roles: Admin, Editor and Viewer. These roles determine what they can do inside of the platform, and what they can do when using the API.

## Add members to your Organisation

Once you've added someone to one of the projects in your organisation, this will add them to the organisation itself.

<Note>You cannot add someone to your Organisation without adding them to one of your projects.</Note>

Once you've added someone to your organisation, you can promote them to an admin of your Organisation by heading to 'Settings' > 'Organization'.
