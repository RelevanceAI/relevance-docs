You can easily switch between different projects in your organization to access different agents, tools, and resources. The method for switching projects depends on whether you're using the Builder platform or Relevance Chat.

## Switch projects in Builder

In the Builder platform, you can switch projects using the project switcher located in the bottom-left sidebar.

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative",paddingTop:"56.25%"}}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cm6n6mh4j00002" frameBorder="0" title="Switch projects in Builder" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

1. Look for the project switcher in the bottom-left corner of your sidebar.
2. Click on the current project name to open the project selector.
3. Select the project you want to switch to from the list.
4. The page will refresh and you'll now be working in the selected project.

<Info>
When you switch projects in Builder, you'll have access to all the agents, tools, datasets, and knowledge sets specific to that project.

## Switch projects in Relevance Chat

In Relevance Chat, you can quickly switch between projects using a keyboard shortcut to open the command palette.

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative",paddingTop:"56.25%"}}>

</div>

## What happens when you switch projects?

When you switch to a different project, you'll have access to:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Project-specific agents" icon="robot">
    All agents built or cloned in that project
  </Card>
  <Card title="Project resources" icon="database">
    Datasets, knowledge sets, and tools specific to that project
  </Card>
  <Card title="Project members" icon="users">
    Collaborate with other members who have access to the project
  </Card>
  <Card title="Project settings" icon="gear">
    Configuration and settings unique to that project
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
Your chat history and saved prompts are project-specific. When you switch projects, you'll see the chat history and prompts associated with the new project.

  <Accordion title="How do I know which project I'm currently in?">
    In Builder, the current project name is displayed in the bottom-left sidebar. In Chat, you can see the current project name in the project switcher or by opening the command palette with Cmd+K / Ctrl+K.
