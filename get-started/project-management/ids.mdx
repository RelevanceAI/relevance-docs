You may need to know your organization, project and agent IDs for various reasons. Here's how to find them.

## URL structure

Relevance AI URLs generally follow this pattern:

```
https://app.relevanceai.com/[SECTION]/[REGION_ID]/[PROJECT_ID]/[AGENT_ID]/...
```

You can also tell what region your organization is in by looking at the URL. 

* **AU**: `f1db6c`
* **EU**: `d7b62b`
* **US**: `bcbe5a`

Here is an example of a Relevance AI URL, broken down into its sections:

```
https://app.relevanceai.com/agents/f1db6c/123456789012-46bf-9cf4-a98611e97a41/43c3a067-0734-4f31-b4c9-3c72dc816519/edit/instructions
```

* **Section**: `agents`
* **Region**: `f1db6c`
* **Project ID**: `123456789012-46bf-9cf4-a98611e97a41`
* **Agent ID**: `43c3a067-0734-4f31-b4c9-3c72dc816519`

## Organization Region

Your organization's region is selected when you sign up to Relevance AI and create your organization. This determines where your data is stored and **cannot be changed after creation**.

### How to identify your region

You can identify your organization's region in two ways:

<Steps>
  <Step title="From the URL">
    Look at any Relevance AI URL while logged in. The region code appears immediately after the section name:
    
    ```
    https://app.relevanceai.com/agents/[REGION_CODE]/...
    ```
    
    The region code will be one of:
    - **US (N. Virginia)**: `bcbe5a`
    - **EU (London)**: `d7b62b`
    - **AU (Sydney)**: `f1db6c`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="From the organization switcher">
    Your region is also displayed in the organization switcher in the Relevance AI interface, shown as a two-letter abbreviation (AU, EU, or US).
    
    <Frame caption="The organization switcher displays your region as a two-letter code. The full region code also appears in your URL.">
      <img src="/images/placeholder-org-region.png" alt="Organization switcher showing region abbreviation" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>
