You may need to know your organization, project and agent IDs for various reasons. Here's how to find them.

## URL structure

Relevance AI URLs generally follow this pattern:

```
https://app.relevanceai.com/[SECTION]/[REGION_ID]/[PROJECT_ID]/[AGENT_ID]/...
```

You can also tell what region your organization is in by looking at the URL. 

* **AU**: `f1db6c`
* **EU**: `d7b62b`
* **US**: `bcbe5a`

Here is an example of a Relevance AI URL, broken down into its sections:

```
https://app.relevanceai.com/agents/f1db6c/123456789012-46bf-9cf4-a98611e97a41/43c3a067-0734-4f31-b4c9-3c72dc816519/edit/instructions
```

* **Section**: `agents`
* **Region**: `f1db6c`
* **Project ID**: `123456789012-46bf-9cf4-a98611e97a41`
* **Agent ID**: `43c3a067-0734-4f31-b4c9-3c72dc816519`
