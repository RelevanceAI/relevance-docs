The Relevance AI Marketplace is a one-stop shop for finding Agents and Tools that match your needs. It offers a curated selection of ready-to-use AI agents designed to automate tasks, streamline workflows, and enhance productivity across a wide range of use cases. Whether you're looking to solve a specific problem or explore what's possible with AI, the Marketplace makes it easy to get started.

## Who can add Agents / Tools to the Marketplace?

Agents and Tools have been created by Relevance AI employees (Rellies) and certified Relevance Builders. 

If you'd like to apply to become a Relevance Builder, please submit the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdA-H3_VHzSLkwKY-JjeZgBpdXK6Tb6EO0WsdwDFJffHZj4Dg/viewform?usp=dialog), and we'll get back to you with more details if you're accepted! 

## Do I have to pay for Agents / Tools?

Some Agents and Tools in the Marketplace require payment. Pricing is determined by the creator of each listing. If you purchase a paid Agent or Tool and it doesnâ€™t perform as expected, you can request a refund within seven days of your purchase. Refunds are not available after this seven-day window.
