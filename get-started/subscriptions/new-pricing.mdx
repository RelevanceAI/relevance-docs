---

As of 8 September 2025, we're changing our pricing model. We're splitting credits into Actions (what your agents do) and Vendor Credits (AI model costs). We will not charge a markup on Vendor Credits -- we pass through exact costs. Credits will roll over indefinitely while you're subscribed, and you can bring your own API keys anytime to bypass Vendor Credits entirely. We've also sunset the Business plan.

Some customers will still be on our old plans, and will be gradually grandfathered into our new pricing model. As a result, to use this page, please navigate to the tab for your plan.

If you're on old billing, you'll only see **credits** in the platform. If you're on new billing, you'll see **Actions** and **Vendor Credits** in the platform.

## What are the biggest changes? 

### Credits will now be split into Actions and Vendor Credits

Actions are what your agents do. Each time a tool runs, it counts as an action — whether it's a simple task like sending one email or running a complex workflow with many steps.

Vendor Credits are the cost of running the AI model. This is the cost of the LLM, and the cost of the tools you use.

Pay only for the LLMs you use, with no markup, and Vendor Credits that never expire while subscribed.

To bypass Vendor Credits entirely, you can bring your own API keys. This is only available on our paid plans and is not available to free users.

We want pricing that’s fair, transparent, and built for the long haul. Passing AI model costs through at wholesale as Vendor Credits (which roll over while you’re subscribed) means we don’t “tax intelligence,” and you get predictable value. Pair that with Actions for clear, trackable work—and you’ve got a setup that scales with you.

### Business plan has been sunset

We felt that our Business plan was not a good fit for our customers, and we wanted to simplify our pricing model. As of 8 September 2025, the Business plan has been sunset. 

Existing Business plan customers will be grandfathered into the new pricing model. You will continue to enjoy Business plan features, but you will eventually need to move to either our Team or Enterprise plan moving forward. 

### Vendor Credits will now roll over indefinitely

Vendor Credits will roll over indefinitely while you're subscribed. This means you'll never run out of credits, and you'll never have to purchase more.

<Warning>
    Actions will not roll over. This means you'll lose your Actions at your next renewal date, and your Actions will reset to your plan's default amount.
</Warning>

### Prices will be slightly higher

We will be increasing the prices of our plans. However, each plan will have a lot more value, and you'll get more for your money.

## Timing and Impact

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="When will the new pricing impact my current subscription?">
        The new pricing is live now for all new customers. If you signed up to Relevance AI after 8 September 2025, you will be on our new pricing model.

        If you are a free user as of 8 September 2025, you will be on our new pricing model as well. If you choose to upgrade to a subscription, you will need to purchase on our new pricing model.

        If you're already on a paid plan, you will continue to use your existing plan and pricing until your first renewal on or after **1 December 2025**.

        For your renewal on or after **1 December 2025**, your subscription will be switched to the equivalent tier on the new pricing model. You'll now see Actions and Vendor Credits, as opposed to Credits. 
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I'm on a monthly Pro / Team plan, what exactly is going to happen to me?">
        Everything will remain the same for your subscription until 1 December 2025. You will continue to be billed at the same rate and see no changes on your renewal in September, October and November.
        
        On your renewal on or after 1 December 2025, you will be charged at the new rate, but be given Actions and Vendor Credits.

        Vendor Credits will roll over, but Actions will not.

        You don't need to do anything -- this will all happen automatically!
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I'm on an annual Pro / Team plan, what exactly is going to happen to me?">
        Everything will remain the same for your subscription until 1 December 2025. 
        
        On your renewal on or after 1 December 2025, you will be charged at the new rate, but be given Actions and Vendor Credits. If your renewal date is 31 August 2026, then that will mean you won't see any changes or increases to your payment until then.

        Vendor Credits will roll over, but Actions will not.

        You don't need to do anything -- this will all happen automatically!
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I'm on a Pro / Team plan, and am really excited by these changes! What if I want to opt into the new model?">
        We're excited that you see the value of these changes! If you want to opt in and start paying at the new rate and get so much new value, [reach out to our support team](/get-started/support) to make the switch!
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I'm on a Pro plan and want to upgrade to Team -- will I move to the new pricing model?">
        No -- you'll stay on the old pricing model Team subscription if you upgrade before 1 December 2025. If you upgrade after 1 December 2025, you'll move to the new pricing model Team subscription. 

        If you wish to move to the new pricing model, you'll need to [reach out to our support team](/get-started/support) to make the switch.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I'm a free user, what exactly is going to happen to me?">
        Existing free users will see changes on **15 September 2025**. New free users will see changes on **8 September 2025**.

        Free users will move from having 100 Credits a day on our old pricing model, to having 200 actions a month. You'll also be given 1000 Vendor Credits once, either when you move to the new model as an existing free user, or sign up to Relevance AI as a new user. 

        If you run out of Vendor Credits or Actions, you'll not be able to purchase more on free. Instead, you'll need to upgrade to a subscription to continue using Relevance AI.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="The new pricing is too expensive for me, I want to cancel">
        We're sorry to see you go! You can cancel your subscription at any time by following the tutorial for your plan [here](/get-started/subscriptions/plans).
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Business customers

Our Business plan will be discontinued on 8 September 2025. If you're on Business, here is how it'll affect you.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="I'm on a Business plan, what exactly is going to happen to me?">
        The Business plan is being discontinued. At your first renewal on or after 1 December 2025, you'll automatically move to the Team plan.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Will I keep my Business features?">
        You'll keep what you already have -- users, projects, and connected triggers. New plan limits will apply moving forward, so you won't be able to add more above those limits unless you upgrade.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What if I downgrade before 1 December 2025?">
        If you downgrade to Pro or Team before 1 December 2025, you'll move to the old pricing model Pro or Team subscription, with Credits as opposed to Actions and Vendor Credits.

        If you wish to move to the new pricing model, you'll need to [reach out to our support team](/get-started/support) to make the switch.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="My company has a dedicated Slack channel as a Business customer. What will happen to that?">
        We'll continue to support you in that Slack channel until your move to Team. After this, we will archive this channel moving forward.

        You'll still have access to world class priority support as a Team customer. Our support team offers support via creating support tickets (either in product or emailing support@relevanceai.com), and we also offer Community support. You can learn more [here](/get-started/support).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Can I upgrade to Enterprise instead to keep my Slack channel and access more advanced features?">
        Absolutely! We'd love to support any customers who wish to upgrade to Enterprise. [Reach out to our support team](/get-started/support) to make the switch, or [book a demo](https://relevanceai.com/book-a-demo). If you have a dedicated Slack channel, feel free to also reach out to us there to discuss making the switch.

## Actions, Agents and Credits

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What are Actions?">
        Actions are what your agents do. Each time a tool runs, it counts as an action — whether it's a simple task like sending one email or running a complex workflow with many steps.

        Actions are charged when you run a Tool, or when your Agent / Workforce runs a Tool. If the Tool fails, this will still count as one Action.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What are Vendor Credits?">    
        Vendor Credits are the cost of running the AI model. This is the cost of the LLM, and the cost of the tools you use.

        Pay only for the LLMs you use, with no markup, and Vendor Credits that never expire while subscribed.

        To bypass Vendor Credits entirely, you can bring your own API keys. This is only available on our paid plans and is not available to free users.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="How do I purchase Actions and Vendor Credits?">
        If you have a paid plan, you can purchase extra Actions and Vendor Credits to use before your next renewal if you run out.

        If you purchase extra Actions, **please note that these do not roll over to the next billing cycle**. You will sacrifice your Actions at your next renewal date, and your Actions will reset to your plan's default amount.

        However, Vendor Credits will roll over to the next billing cycle.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What happens to my existing credits when I move to the new pricing model?">
        At the time you switch (your renewal), your current plan’s credits reset as usual. After that, on the new pricing, Vendor Credits roll over indefinitely while your paid subscription stays active.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Do I need to modify my agents to start using Actions?">
        Nope. Actions are automatically tracked on the new pricing. You’ll be able to see how many Actions each task uses.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Can I purchase additional Actions and Vendor Credits if I run out?">
        Yes! You can purchase additional Actions and Vendor Credits if you have a subscription.

        Additional Actions, like Actions that come with your plan, do not roll over to the next billing cycle. However, additional Vendor Credits will roll over to the next billing cycle.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Can I bring my own API keys to bypass Vendor Credits?">
        Yes! You can bring your own API keys to bypass Vendor Credits entirely. This is only available on our paid plans and is not available to free users.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Seats, Users and Projects

We'll now be enforcing user / seat limits, as well as project limits, in our new pricing model.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What happens to my existing users under the new seat limits?">
        All of your current users will stay in your new organization, and you won't be charged extra for them. If you're over the new limit, you won't be able to add any more users until you remove users and get back under your limit.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I have more projects than I'm allowed to have at my current subscription level. What happens to them?">
        All of your existing projects will remain in your organization and be accessible. If you wish to create new projects, you'll either need to upgrade to a higher plan, or delete projects until you can add new ones under your limit.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integrations

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What happens to my Salesforce integration and triggers now that they're Enterprise only?">
        Anything you've already connected will keep working unless you remove it. New Salesforce triggers will require the Enterprise plan.

        If you're interested in upgrading to Enterprise, [reach out to our support team](/get-started/support), or [book a demo](https://relevanceai.com/book-a-demo).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What tier can I use Salesforce, Snowflake and Zendesk triggers on?">
        You'll need to be on the Enterprise plan to use Salesforce, Snowflake and Zendesk triggers. If you're interested in upgrading to Enterprise, [reach out to our support team](/get-started/support), or [book a demo](https://relevanceai.com/book-a-demo).
