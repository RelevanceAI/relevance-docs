Spend Controls allows you to configure automatic top-up limits for both your Actions and Vendor Credits, ensuring your account never runs out of credits unexpectedly.

<Note>
  Spend Controls is available to Pro and Team plan users (monthly and annual). You must be on our new pricing model to access this feature. If you're still on the old pricing model with Credits (not Actions and Vendor Credits), you won't have access to Spend Controls yet.

## How to configure spend controls

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmj87stxg28ijbyg7xo7zobql" frameBorder="0" title="How to configure spend controls" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

1. Click on **Settings** in the sidebar, then select **Spend controls**
2. Click **Start** on either auto-recharge for **Actions** or **Vendor Credits**
3. Set your minimum threshold (the credit balance that triggers an automatic top-up when your balance falls below this limit)
4. Set your top-up amount (the amount added above your minimum threshold when a top-up occurs)

<Note>
  The same configuration process applies to both Actions and Vendor Credits. You can set up separate limits for each type of credit based on your usage patterns.
</Note>

## How top-ups work

When your balance drops below your minimum threshold, you'll automatically be charged to bring your balance up to your **minimum threshold + top-up amount**.

For example, if you have 1000 credits remaining with a minimum threshold of 10000 and a top-up amount of 1000, you'll be charged for 10000 credits to bring your balance to 11000 — not just 1000 credits.
