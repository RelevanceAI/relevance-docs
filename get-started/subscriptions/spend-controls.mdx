</Warning>

## How to Access Spend Controls

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Click on **Settings** in the sidebar, then select **Spend controls**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your credit type">
    Click **Start** on either auto-recharge for **Actions** or **Vendor Credits**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Steps

There are two simple steps to configure Spend Controls for each credit type:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Set a minimum threshold" icon="gauge-min">
    This is the credit balance that will trigger an automatic top-up when your balance falls below this limit.
    
    For example, if you set your minimum threshold to 10,000 credits, the system will automatically top up your account when your balance drops below 10,000.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Step 2: Set a top-up amount" icon="arrow-up">
    This is the amount **above** the minimum threshold that your balance will be topped up to.
    
    For example, if you set your top-up amount to 1,000 credits, your account will be topped up to 1,000 credits above your minimum threshold.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding How the Calculation Works

<Warning>
  Understanding how Spend Controls calculates your top-up is crucial to avoid unexpected charges.
</Warning>

The top-up amount is added **above** your minimum threshold, not added to your current balance.

### Example Calculation

Let's walk through a real example:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your current settings">
    - Current balance: **1,000 credits**
    - Minimum threshold: **10,000 credits**
    - Top-up amount: **1,000 credits**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="What happens when you fall below the threshold">
    When your balance falls below 10,000 credits, the system will automatically top you up to **11,000 credits** (not 2,000 credits).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="How it's calculated">
    The system brings you to your **minimum threshold (10,000)** plus the **top-up amount (1,000)** you configured.
    
    **Formula:** Final Balance = Minimum Threshold + Top-up Amount
    
    **Result:** 10,000 + 1,000 = 11,000 credits
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  The top-up amount is added **above** your minimum threshold, ensuring you always have a buffer of credits to work with after the automatic top-up occurs.
</Tip>

## How to Configure Spend Controls

Follow this interactive guide to set up Spend Controls for your Actions or Vendor Credits:

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>
