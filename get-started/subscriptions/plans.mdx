<Warning>
  As of 1 September 2025, we're changing our pricing model. We're splitting credits into Actions (what your agents do) and Vendor Credits (AI model costs). We will not charge a markup on Vendor Credits -- we pass through exact costs. Credits will roll over indefinitely while you're subscribed, and you can bring your own API keys anytime to bypass Vendor Credits entirely. We've also sunset the Business plan.

  Some customers will still be on our old plans, and will be gradually grandfathered into our new pricing model. As a result, to use this page, please navigate to the tab for your plan.

  If you're on old billing, you'll only see **credits** in the platform. If you're on new billing, you'll see **Actions** and **Vendor Credits** in the platform.

  To read a full breakdown of all the changes, you can read our FAQs [here](/get-started/subscriptions/new-pricing).
</Warning>

    ## Understanding Actions

    An Action is a single run of a Tool. Each time a tool runs, it counts as an action â€” whether it's a simple task like sending one email or running a complex workflow with many steps.

    Actions are charged when you run a Tool, or when your Agent / Workforce runs a Tool. If the Tool fails, this will still count as one Action.

    ## Understanding Vendor Credits

    Vendor Credits are the cost of running the AI model. This is the cost of the LLM, and the cost of the tools you use.

    Pay only for the LLMs you use, with no markup, and credits that never expire while subscribed.

    To bypass Vendor Credits entirely, you can bring your own API keys. This is only available on our paid plans and is not available to free users.

    ## Purchasing additional Actions and Vendor Credits

    If you have a paid plan, you can purchase extra Actions and Vendor Credits to use before your next renewal if you run out.

    ## Monitoring Actions and Vendor Credits usage

    ### At an Organization level

    To check your Actions and Vendor Credits consumption at an Organization level:

    1. Click 'Settings' in the sidebar
    2. Navigate to Plan & Billing

    <Warning>
      You'll only have access to this section if you are an admin of your Organization.
    </Warning>

    ![Marketing image for plan and billing](/images/new-plan-billing.png)

    From this page, you will be able to see credit usage across your entire Organization, and view this by Agent or see a detailed view of your credit expenses.

    ### At an individual Agent level

    You can also see how many Actions and Vendor Credits your Agent used, broken down by each Tool and your Agent's LLM cost. 

    <div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative",paddingTop:"56.25%" }}>
    <iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmdy9kmsa8eo39f96j64ckfzb" frameBorder="0" title="How to view the credit usage of an Agent run" allow="clipboard-write" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
    </div>

    1. First, access the run of your Agent you want to view credits on, on the Run screen
    2. Click the number next to 'Credits used'
    3. This will open a pop-up that will show you how much each Tool cost, as well as your Agent LLM cost and the base run cost

    ### How many Vendor Credits and Actions do I have left?

    <img
      src="/images/new-credits-counter.png"
      alt="Image showing the credits counter in Relevance AI, and explaining that the counter shows the number of credits remaining over the number of credits in your plan per month / year"
      className="mx-auto"
    />

    You can view how many Actions and Vendor Credits you have left in the bottom left of Relevance AI. The credits counter will show you a total of the **number of Actions and Vendor Credits you have left remaining** over the **number of Actions and Vendor Credits you receive in your plan per month / year**.

    The color of the counter also indicates how many credits you have remaining based on how many you have in your billing period. If your counter is green, this means you're in a good position\! If the counter turns red, you should consider adding more credits if you think you're going to run out before your next renewal, or consider upgrading to a higher plan in the future.

    For example, in the image above, this user is on a Pro plan, billed monthly. They currently receive 2500 Actions per month, and 3000 Vendor Credits. They have 1267 Actions and 1995 Vendor Credits left.

    ## Credit allocation and reset

    For paid plans, Vendor Credits and Actions will be topped up at your next renewal date. Your Vendor Credits will roll over, but your Actions will not.

    For free users, you will be given 1000 Vendor Credits when you sign up to Relevance AI, and 200 Actions a month. To access more Vendor Credits, you'll need to upgrade to a subscription.

    ## Paying for plans

    At this time, we only offer the ability to pay for subscriptions using a credit card. We do not support debit cards at this time.

    ## Cancelling your subscription 
    You can easily cancel your subscription if you are an organization admin by following this tutorial:
    
    <div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative",paddingTop:"56.25%" }}>

    </div>
    
    1. Click 'Manage plan' at the bottom of the platform
    2. Click 'Cancel subscription'
    3. On the pop-up that opens, click 'Cancel subscription' _again_ to make sure the cancellation goes through
    4. You should then be directed to a pop-up confirming that you've cancelled successfully

    ## Invoices and receipts

    Your invoices and receipts will be sent to your billing contact. This is the person who purchased the subscription originally. These invoices and receipts will be sent every renewal to this person. 

    If another member of your organization needs to view invoices and receipts, please forward them onto these team members via email.

    <Warning>We currently do not have the ability to self-serve invoices and receipts in platform, but hope to add this functionality soon. If you have any questions, please [reach out to our support team](https://relevanceai.com/docs/get-started/support).</Warning>

    ## Understanding credits

    Relevance provides a variety of plans enabling you to choose the best option according to your needs.

    Each plan supports a certain number of users, credits per execution, specific data size and certain Large Language Models.

    Below is a brief overview of the available plans and their specification.

    For the most updated list, please visit Relevance AI's [pricing](https://relevanceai.com/pricing) page.

    <Note>
      It is always possible to upgrade or downgrade your plan based on your usage and workload\!
    </Note>

    ### Base credits costs

    The base cost for running any tool or agent is 4 credits. However, this cost varies depending on your plan.

    | Plan       | Credits per run |
    | ---------- | --------------- |
    | Free       | 4               |
    | Pro        | 4               |
    | Team       | 3               |
    | Business   | 2               |
    | Enterprise | 2               |

    ### How many credits do I have left?

    <img
      src="/images/credit-counter-explanation.png"
      alt="Image showing the credits counter in Relevance AI, and explaining that the counter shows the number of credits remaining over the number of credits in your plan per month / year"
      className="mx-auto"
    />

    You can view how many credits you have left in the bottom left of Relevance AI. The credits counter will show you a total of the **number of credits you have left remaining** over the **number of credits you receive in your plan per month / year** (or day if you're a free user).

    The color of the counter also indicates how many credits you have remaining based on how many you have in your billing period. If your counter is green, this means you're in a good position\! If the counter turns red, you should consider adding more credits if you think you're going to run out before your next renewal, or consider upgrading to a higher plan in the future.

    For example, in the image above, this user is on a Team plan, billed monthly. They currently receive 100,000 credits per month, and have 75,500 left. They have 14 days left, and are in a good position to continue using Relevance AI until their next renewal period.

    ### What affects total credit cost?

    Your total credit consumption depends on several factors:

    #### Tool steps

    - When using integrations without your own API key, additional credits are charged since you're using our API keys.
    - If you provide your own API key, no additional credits are charged for integrations.

    #### Large Language Model selection

    - Different models have different credit costs.
    - Specific costs can be found in the `model` selector within the platform.

    <Frame>
      ![](/images/model-selector.png)
    </Frame>

    #### Knowledge sync

    - Knowledge is our RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) solution that enables you to provide additional context to your agents and tools.
    - When syncing knowledge, yourdata is vectorized to enable search capabilities.
    - Knowledge sync operations have the same base credit cost as a tool run.

    ### Credit allocation and reset

    #### Reset schedule

    - **Free Plan:** Credits reset daily at midnight, Sydney time (AEST / AEDT)
    - **Paid Plans:** Credits reset at your next renewal date

    ### Purchasing additional credits

    If you have a paid plan, you can purchase extra credits to use before your next renewal if you run out.

    If you purchase these extra credits, **please note that these do not roll over to the next billing cycle**. You will sacrifice your credits at your next renewal date, and your credits will reset to your plan's default amount.

    The minimum amount of credits you can purchase is 10000 credits (\$20 USD).

    ### Monitoring credit usage

    #### At an Organization level

    To check your credit consumption at an Organization level:

    1. Click 'Settings' in the sidebar

    ## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="I've accidentally upgraded with annual billing, but I meant to upgrade with monthly billing. How do I change to monthly billing going forward?">
        Unfortunately if you change in platform, this change will only be put into place at your next renewal date in a year.

        If you want to change to monthly billing immediately, you'll need to [reach out to our support team](https://relevanceai.com/docs/get-started/support).
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="I've just renewed but it's showing that I've already used all of my credits?">
        Check your credit counter to make sure you've read this correctly. Your credits counter will show you **the number of credits you have left to use**, not the number of credits you've used.

        If your counter is showing 10100 credits over 10000, for instance, this means you have 10100 credits left to use in your current billing period, not that you've used 10100 credits.
