If you need help or have questions, our support team is here to assist you! There are three ways to get support, either from our team or from fellow customers.

## Relevance AI Community

The [Relevance AI Community](https://community.relevanceai.com) is a platform to connect with fellow Relevance AI customers, Partners, AI experts and Rellies (Relevance AI team members).

If you're looking for support from your fellow users, including advice on how to build using our platform, we'd recommend reaching out to the Community and creating a question [here](https://community.relevanceai.com/c/questions/).

<Warning>
  Please note that this space is primarily monitored by our Community members, and is considered a peer to peer Community space. If your question in the Community has been left unanswered, you are welcome to reach out to our support team for help using the methods below.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I am on the old Business plan, what support and SLAs are available to me?">
    As a Business customer, if you already have a dedicated Slack channel, you can continue to use it to reach out to support. However, if you request to create a channel, we will not be able to create a channel for you, as the Business plan is in the process of being sunset.

    We offer Enterprise SLAs to Business customers, regardless of whether they reach out to us via Slack, email or chat.

    On your first renewal date on or after 1 December 2025, you'll be moved to the Team plan, and you'll have access to Team SLAs. If you have a dedicated Slack channel, this will be archived. If you wish to continue to have priority support, you will need to upgrade to Enterprise. If you'd like to discuss an upgrade to Enterprise, please reach out to support via your Slack channel or one of the methods listed above.
