If you need help or have questions, our support team is here to assist you\! There are three ways to get support, either from our team or from fellow customers:

## Relevance AI Community

The [Relevance AI Community](https://community.relevanceai.com) is a platform to connect with fellow Relevance AI customers, Partners, AI experts and Rellies (Relevance AI team members). 

If you're looking for support from your fellow users, including advice on how to build using our platform, we'd recommend reaching out to the Community and creating a question [here](https://community.relevanceai.com/c/questions/).

<Warning>Please note that this space is primarily monitored by our Community members, and is considered a peer to peer Community space. If your question in the Community has been left unanswered, you are welcome to reach out to our support team for help using the methods below.</Warning>

## In-app chat ticket support

The fastest way to get in touch is through our in-app chat support:

1. Log in to your [Relevance AI dashboard](https://app.relevanceai.com/).
2. Click the **"Need Help?"** button, found in the bottom left corner of the screen.
3. This will open our chat window, where you can send your message directly to our support team, or ask our AI Agent
