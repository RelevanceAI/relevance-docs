If you need help or have questions, our support team is here to assist you! There are three ways to get support, either from our team or from fellow customers.

## Relevance AI Community

The [Relevance AI Community](https://community.relevanceai.com) is a platform to connect with fellow Relevance AI customers, Partners, AI experts and Rellies (Relevance AI team members).

If you're looking for support from your fellow users, including advice on how to build using our platform, we'd recommend reaching out to the Community and creating a question [here](https://community.relevanceai.com/c/questions/).

<Warning>
  Please note that this space is primarily monitored by our Community members, and is considered a peer to peer Community space. If your question in the Community has been left unanswered, you are welcome to reach out to our support team for help using the methods below.

## How we use AI Agents in our support process

At Relevance AI, we practice what we preach—we're AI-first and use our own AI Agent platform across all teams, including support. Our AI Agents are integrated throughout our support process to help us deliver faster, more consistent assistance to our customers.

### What our AI Agents do

Our AI Agents assist with:
- **Answering customer questions** with accurate, up-to-date information
- **Researching our platform** to provide detailed technical guidance
- **Drafting documentation** to keep our knowledge base current and comprehensive

### Support by subscription tier

The level of AI and human support you receive depends on your subscription:

## Working with our team: Rules of engagement

We're committed to providing excellent support to all our customers in a respectful and professional environment. To ensure we can continue delivering the best possible service, we ask that all interactions follow these guidelines.

### Professional communication standards

We expect all communications with our team to be professional and respectful. **Aggressive, antagonistic, or abusive language—including swearing—will prevent us from assisting you.** Our team members deserve a safe and respectful work environment, and these standards apply across all channels, including support tickets, email, and Community forums.

### Terms & Conditions

Our commitment to a respectful environment is outlined in our [Terms & Conditions](https://relevanceai.com/terms-and-conditions). Specifically, Section 6.2 prohibits intimidating, harassing, threatening, bullying, or endangering any member of our team. We reserve the right to suspend or cancel accounts for violations of these terms.

### Consequences of violations

If communication becomes disrespectful or abusive, we may:
- **Pause support** until communication becomes respectful
- **Suspend your account** temporarily
- **Terminate your account** for repeated or severe violations

We don't take these actions lightly, but we must protect our team members and maintain a positive environment for all customers.

### Constructive feedback is welcome

We genuinely welcome constructive criticism about our products and services—it helps us improve! We encourage you to share your feedback professionally, focusing on the issues rather than attacking individuals. Respectful communication helps us serve you and all our customers better.

### Community guidelines

The same standards apply to our [Community forums](https://community.relevanceai.com). Our Community guidelines are inspired by [Atlassian's Community Guidelines](https://community.atlassian.com/forums/custom/page/page-id/rules-of-engagement), which promote respectful and productive discussions. Violations may result in post removal or account suspension from the Community.

<Tip>
**Remember:** We're here to help you succeed. Professional, respectful communication ensures we can focus on solving your problems and delivering the support you deserve.
</Tip>

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I am on the old Business plan, what support and SLAs are available to me?">
    As a Business customer, if you already have a dedicated Slack channel, you can continue to use it to reach out to support. However, if you request to create a channel, we will not be able to create a channel for you, as the Business plan is in the process of being sunset.

    We offer Enterprise SLAs to Business customers, regardless of whether they reach out to us via Slack, email or chat.

    On your first renewal date on or after 1 December 2025, you'll be moved to the Team plan, and you'll have access to Team SLAs. If you have a dedicated Slack channel, this will be archived. If you wish to continue to have priority support, you will need to upgrade to Enterprise. If you'd like to discuss an upgrade to Enterprise, please reach out to support via your Slack channel or one of the methods listed above.
