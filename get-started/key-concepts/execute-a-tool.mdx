description: 'How to execute a Tool/Template on a single data sample or on the whole dataset'

When we [design a Tool](/custom-tools/create-a-tool) or use an [existing template](templates/introduction), 
we can 
1. Single Run the Tool: test the Tool/Template on individual sample inputs
2. Bulk Run the Tool: use a dataset as input and let the Tool/Template to fetch the input data directly from the source 
and apply the analysis to the whole dataset in one go.

### Single Run
Analyzing one input sample with the Tool/Template.

#### On the Tool/APP page
![Single run - app](/images/get-started/tool-app.png)
Clicking on `Run once` on the APP page, after providing all the required inputs will execute the Tool
and provide you with the analysis results.

#### On the Build page
Tools can be tested on the Build page as well.
Build is where different components are combined together to form
the whole input to analysis results flow.

Once the tool is ready, provide all the required inputs and you can
1. execute each step component in order by clicking on the "play" button on each step
2. Use the `Run all` button located on the top right

Final analysis result will be shown at the bottom of the page. Noe that you can see the 
output of each step by clicking on `+ Expand` at the step.

### Bulk Run
Bulk run is to apply a Tool or Template not just on an individual input sample, but on the whole dataset.

#### On the Tool/Run in bulk page
![Bulk run - Tool](/images/get-started/tool-bulk-run.png)
Going to the "Run in bulk" page, you have access to `Run on my data` button. This button directs 
you to the [Data](/get-started/key-concepts/data.mdx) page. Tool and template execution from the 
Data table is explained in the next section.

#### On the Data table page
Select your target dataset the the [Data](/get-started/key-concepts/data.mdx) page.
Once the data table is opened, you can "Enrich" your data using any of the analysis Tools and Templates.
![Bulk run - Table](/images/get-started/bulk-run-table.png)

"Enrich" will add a new column to your dataset including the analysis results per rows.

1. Select the desired Tool/Templates
2. Fill in the form 
    a. Use `Manually type data` when the input is not available in the dataset
    b. Select the column where the input data can be fetched from the dataset
3. Click on `Confirm` to finalize the enrichment setup
4. Once the enrichment is setup, you will see a new column added to your table. This column allows you 
to run the enrichment on one individual row, or on the whole table as shown in the image below.
