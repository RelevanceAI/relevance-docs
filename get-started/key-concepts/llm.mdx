Large Language Models (LLMs) are one of the latest and most successful achievements of AI. 
LLMs are powered by massive neural networks and deep learning techniques. 
These networks are trained on huge datasets with sizes beyond imagination. 
Such a dataset and the state of the art hardware and software have enable these models to 
accurately understand and generate natural language. Some of LLMs' top use cases are summarization 
and question answering.

More information about using LLMs at Relevance is provided at [LLM](/build-custom-tools/tool-steps/llms/llm).
