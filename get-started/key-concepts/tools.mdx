## What are tools?

Tools are how you build integrations, LLM prompt chains or other step by step automations. You can build them in our no code tool builder. You can then share them as a form, run them in bulk on knowledge tables, or give them to your agents to help them complete work.

The possibilities are vast. You can tap into any API, choose from our extensive library of third-party integrations, or even incorporate custom code into your tools.

## How do they work?

**Receive inputs**
Inputs define the data that a tool will process and act upon. Tools accept various types of inputs, such as text or numbers. These inputs can be provided manually by users or agents, or passed from other tools.

**Chain together steps**
Steps are the core actions that a tool performs. They can include operations like LLM prompts,  API calls, or custom code execution.

Steps are arranged in a logical sequence, with each step potentially using outputs from previous steps.

**Generate outputs**
After processing the inputs through its chain of steps, the tool produces one or more outputs.

Outputs can be in various formats, such as text, links or HTML.

These outputs can be displayed to users, stored in databases, or passed to other tools or agents for further processing.
