## What is Knowledge?

Knowledge is our RAG solution in Relevance AI, which allows you to provide additional context and relevant information to your agents and tools.

## How do I create Knowledge?

Creating knowledge in Relevance AI is simple and flexible. You can:

- **Manually input data** - Start with an empty table and enter information directly.
- **Upload structured and unstructured data** - Import files such as CSV, PDF, Excel, JSON, or even audio files.
- **Extract content from a website** - Fetch text and relevant information from URLs.
- **Connect third-party integrations** - Sync data from external platforms.
