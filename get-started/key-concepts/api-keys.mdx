## What Are API Keys?

API keys are unique codes that let different software talk to each other. They act as a way to identify who is trying to connect and make sure the connection is secure.

Think of an API key like a special key card you use to enter a building. It tells the system who you are and what you're allowed to do. Every time an app wants to connect to another app, it shows this key card.

<Warning>
  You can think of API keys as a form of a password so these should never be shared.
</Warning>

## API Key Roles: Default vs Admin

Relevance API keys come in two roles with different permission levels: **Default** and **Admin**. Understanding the difference is important for security and proper access control.

### Permission Comparison

| Feature | Default Key | Admin Key |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Tool execution** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Agent execution** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Project-level operations** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Invite users to project** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Update user roles** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Delete project invites** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Remove users from project** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Organization-level endpoints** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

### Default API Keys

Default keys are designed for standard project-level operations and are suitable for most use cases.

**What Default keys can do:**
- Execute tools and agents
- Access project data and resources
- Perform standard API operations
- Run workflows and automations

**Use Default keys when:**
- Building integrations that execute tools or agents
- Automating workflows within a project
- Accessing project data programmatically
- You don't need user management capabilities

<Tip>
  Default keys follow the principle of least privilege. Use them for most API operations to minimize security risk.
</Tip>

### Admin API Keys

Admin keys have elevated permissions for organization and user management operations.

**What Admin keys can do:**
- Everything Default keys can do, plus:
- Invite users to projects
- Update user roles within projects
- Delete project invitations
- Remove users from projects
- Access organization-level endpoints

**Use Admin keys when:**
- Building user management integrations
- Automating team onboarding/offboarding
- Managing project access programmatically
- You need organization-level administrative control

<Warning>
  Admin keys have elevated permissions. Store them securely and only use them when administrative operations are required.
</Warning>

### Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use the principle of least privilege" icon="shield-check">
    Always use Default keys unless you specifically need Admin permissions. This limits potential damage if a key is compromised.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rotate keys regularly" icon="rotate">
    Periodically generate new API keys and revoke old ones, especially for Admin keys or if you suspect a key may have been exposed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Store keys securely" icon="lock">
    Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment variables or secure secret management systems to store keys.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor key usage" icon="chart-line">
    Regularly review which keys are being used and for what purposes. Revoke any keys that are no longer needed.
  </Accordion>

## Relevance API Keys

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%"}}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmbg69nup4eyssn1rt129znrs?embed_v=2" frameBorder="0" title="Create a Relevance API key" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px",objectFit:"cover" }} />
</div>

You can generate your own Relevance API key to use tools or agents in other platforms.

### Generating API Keys with Specific Roles

When creating a new API key in the Relevance dashboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    Go to your project settings and select the API Keys section.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create New Key">
    Click "Create API Key" to generate a new key.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Role">
    Choose between **Default** or **Admin** role based on your needs:
    - Select **Default** for standard operations (recommended for most use cases)
    - Select **Admin** only if you need user management or organization-level access
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name Your Key">
    Give your key a descriptive name that indicates its purpose (e.g., "Production Tool Execution" or "User Management Integration").
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Securely">
    Copy the generated key immediately and store it securely. You won't be able to see it again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using API Keys in Your Code

Here's how to use your API keys when making requests to the Relevance API:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
const RELEVANCE_API_KEY = process.env.RELEVANCE_API_KEY;

// Using a Default key for tool execution
const response = await fetch('https://api-bcbe33.stack.tryrelevance.com/latest/studios/YOUR_STUDIO_ID/trigger_limited', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${RELEVANCE_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    // Your tool parameters
  })
});
```

```python Python
import os
import requests

RELEVANCE_API_KEY = os.environ.get('RELEVANCE_API_KEY')

# Using a Default key for agent execution
response = requests.post(
    'https://api-bcbe33.stack.tryrelevance.com/latest/agents/YOUR_AGENT_ID/trigger',
    headers={
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {RELEVANCE_API_KEY}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    json={
        # Your agent parameters
    }
)
```

```bash cURL
# Using an Admin key for user management
curl -X POST \
  https://api-bcbe33.stack.tryrelevance.com/latest/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/invite \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "role": "member"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Replace `YOUR_STUDIO_ID`, `YOUR_AGENT_ID`, `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`, and `YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY` with your actual values. Always use environment variables to store API keys, never hardcode them.
</Note>

## Custom API Keys

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%"}}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmbg0620b4azssn1r2pkbsbvl?embed_v=2" frameBorder="0" title="Create a custom API key" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px",objectFit:"cover" }} />
</div>

If the integration you would like to use is not on the list, you can add a custom one.

To access your custom keys, you can get to it using `{{secrets.chains_your_api_key}}`
