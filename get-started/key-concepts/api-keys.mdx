## What Are API Keys?

API keys are unique codes that let different software talk to each other. They act as a way to identify who is trying to connect and make sure the connection is secure.

Think of an API key like a special key card you use to enter a building. It tells the system who you are and what youâ€™re allowed to do. Every time an app wants to connect to another app, it shows this key card.

<Warning>
  You can think of API keys as a form of a password so these should never be shared.

## Relevance API Keys


<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    position: 'relative',
    paddingTop: '56.25%',
  }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmbeoyan532xfsn1rpstgz8rq?embed_v=2"
    frameBorder="0"
    title="Build an AI agent from scratch in Relevance AI"
    allow="clipboard-write"
    webkitallowfullscreen="true"
    mozallowfullscreen="true"
    allowfullscreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%',
      border: '3px solid #5E43CE',
      borderRadius: '10px',
    }}/>
</div>



You can also generate your own Relevance API key to use tools or agents in other platforms.

## Custom API Keys


<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    position: 'relative',
    paddingTop: '56.25%',
  }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://app.supademo.com/demo/cmbeq239033gnsn1rutaovwka"
    frameBorder="0"
    title="Build an AI agent from scratch in Relevance AI"
    allow="clipboard-write"
    webkitallowfullscreen="true"
    mozallowfullscreen="true"
    allowfullscreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%',
      border: '3px solid #5E43CE',
      borderRadius: '10px',
    }}/>
</div>




If the integration you would like to use is not on the list, you can add a custom one.

To access your custom keys, you can get to it using `{{secrets.chains_your_api_key}}`
