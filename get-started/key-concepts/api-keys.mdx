## What Are API Keys?

API keys are unique codes that let different software talk to each other. They act as a way to identify who is trying to connect and make sure the connection is secure. 

Think of an API key like a special key card you use to enter a building. It tells the system who you are and what youâ€™re allowed to do. Every time an app wants to connect to another app, it shows this key card.

<Warning>You can think of API keys as a form of a password so these should never be shared.</Warning>
