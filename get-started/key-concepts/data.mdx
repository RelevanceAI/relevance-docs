At Relevance, you can upload variety of data sources to be used by AI as knowledge or sources of 
truth. 
You are not limited to one or two data formats but many such as PDF, CSV, Audio, Websites, 
as well as a huge range of integrations such as Figma, Zendesk and YouTube are supported.

Click on `+ Create table` button and you will be prompted with the upload data flow.
Any data that is uploaded as [Knowledge](/custom-tools/knowledge) in any of your Tools will also be
stored and shown under this page.

<Tip>
**Data vs Knowledge**

Data is any source of truth that you upload to the platform. 
Knowledge is the processed data that is used by AI. 

For instance a PDF file is Data but the Vectorized data (i.e. Vectorized PDF)
is knowledge for a Question-Answering AI engine.
