One of the missions at Relevance is to design and maintain Chains that can be widely beneficial
across different use-cases.
Such chains are available under Templates.
Detailed explanation of each chain can be found under [Templates](/templates/templates).
![Home page](/images/templates/templates-page.png)

Note that you can use the templates as they are or clone them. 
Cloning makes a copy of the template in your account and you will have full permission to modify the
chains to better suit your needs. More information are provided at [customized chains](/custom-chains/create-a-chain).
