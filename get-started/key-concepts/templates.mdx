One of the missions at Relevance is to design and maintain Tools that can be widely beneficial
across different use-cases.
Such Tools are available under Templates.
Detailed explanation of each Tool can be found under [Templates](/templates/introduction).
![Home page](/images/templates/templates-page.png)

Note that you can use the templates as they are or [clone](/templates/introduction#clone-a-template-create-a-copy-of-a-tool-in-your-account) them. 
Cloning makes a copy of the template in your account and you will have full permission to modify the
Tools to better suit your needs. More information are provided at [customized Tools](/build-custom-tools/create-a-tool).
