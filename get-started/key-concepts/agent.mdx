## What are AI agents?

Agents are reasoning bots powered by LLMs that plan and complete tasks on autopilot. They are given tools, and decide how to use tools to achieve their goals and complete work.

## What can they do?

**Can be taught specific roles**

AI agents can be equipped with domain-specific knowledge, allowing them to operate in fields such as marketing, sales, operations or any other area relevant to your business needs.

**Can plan**

When given with a task, AI agents use reasoning skills to analyze the requirements and determine the most effective approach to complete their work. This involves breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps and prioritizing actions.

**Can make decisions**

AI agents are adaptable, much like skilled human workers. They're great at at making smart choices on the fly, using the latest information to pick the best course of action. When things don't go as planned, they can finding new ways to get the job done. This flexibility allows them to juggle multiple goals, seize unexpected opportunities, and learn from their experiences.

**Can use tools**

Agents are capable of using a variety of tools created through Relevance AI's no-code builder. This allows you to extend your agents' capabilities to complete specific tasks.

**Can integrate with other systems**

AI agents integrate with your current business processes and software. They can follow established workflows and use the same applications as your human workforce.

AI agents can be equipped with domain-specific knowledge, allowing them to operate in fields such as marketing, sales, operations or any other area relevant to your business needs.

## How AI agents work

Agents in Relevance AI can operate in different ways:

- **Autopilot** - They complete tasks independently.
- **Human in the loop** - Asking humans for input or approval when needed.

You can trigger agents to start work with:

- **Pre-built integrations** - Seamlessly connect with existing tools.
- **API access** - Use them in your applications.
- **User interface** - Run agents directly from our platform.
