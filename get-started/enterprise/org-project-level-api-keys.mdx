<Warning>
  Organization- and project-level API keys are gradually being rolled out to our Enterprise customers. If you have an Enterprise subscription with Relevance AI and do not have access to this feature yet, please reach out to your sales representative to share your interest in this feature.

  You will not be able to access this feature if you are not on an Enterprise subscription.
</Warning>

Enterprise subscriptions allow you to set API keys at both a project level and organization level.

## How do I set organization-level API keys?

<Note>
  If you set an API key at the organization level, any projects in this organization will use this API key _unless_ an API key is added at the project level.
