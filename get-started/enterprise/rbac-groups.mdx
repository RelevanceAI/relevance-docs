<Warning>
  RBAC Groups is gradually being rolled out to our Enterprise customers. If you have an Enterprise subscription with Relevance AI and do not have access to this feature yet, please reach out to your sales representative to share your interest in this feature.

  You will not be able to access this feature if you are not on an Enterprise subscription.
</Warning>

RBAC Groups enables organizations to connect their identity provider (IDP) such as Entra ID or Okta directly to Relevance AI. This allows bulk assignment of users via groups to projects and assets, as well as setting their permissions. Instead of manually assigning hundreds of users individually, organizations can assign entire groups (like "Marketing Team" or "Sales Operations") to projects and agents.

This feature dramatically simplifies user management for large teams by leveraging your existing organizational structure from your identity provider.

## Setting Up RBAC Groups

To use RBAC Groups, your organization must first connect your identity provider through WorkOS. WorkOS provides secure integrations with major identity providers including Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) and Okta.

<Note>
  For detailed instructions on setting up your specific identity provider with WorkOS, please refer to the [official WorkOS integration documentation](https://workos.com/docs/integrations).
</Note>

Once your IDP is connected, groups from your identity provider will automatically sync to Relevance AI and become available for assignment.

## Organization-Level Groups

![Organization Groups Overview](/images/rbac-groups/org-groups.png)

<Note>
  Organization-level groups are only accessible to organization admins and owners.
</Note>

At the organization level, you can view all groups that have been synced from your identity provider. This provides a centralized view of your organizational structure within Relevance AI.

### Accessing organization groups

To view organization-level groups:

1. Click **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Select **Organization**
3. Click the **User Groups** tab

The groups page displays the name, source (e.g., Entra ID, Okta), and member count for each group synced from your identity provider.

To view who is in a group and the permissions they have, simply click on the group. You'll see the complete membership list and group details.

<Info>
  IDP groups are read-only in Relevance AI. To modify group membership, make changes in your identity provider and they will sync automatically.
</Info>

## Project-Level Groups

![Adding Groups to Projects](/images/rbac-groups/project-groups.png)

Groups can be assigned to projects to give all group members access to that project. This is particularly useful for onboarding entire teams or departments to specific projects.

When adding a group to a project, you'll assign them a [project-level role](/get-started/enterprise/rbac#project-level-controls) (Admin, Editor, Member, Chat, or Viewer) which determines what they can do within that project.

### Adding groups to projects

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmhebwgnb3mp9fatip57eyru5" frameBorder="0" title="Add groups to projects" allow="clipboard-write" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

To add a group to a project:

1. Head to the **Invite to project** screen (either through Settings or by clicking your profile picture in Relevance AI)
2. Click **Assign Group**
3. Select the group(s) you want to add
4. Select the role you want the group to have (Admin, Editor, Member, Chat, or Viewer)

<Warning>
  When you add a group to a project, all members of that group will be added to the project with the specified role. If any group members are not already part of the project, they will be automatically added.
</Warning>

## Asset-Level Groups

![Adding Groups to Assets](/images/rbac-groups/asset-groups.png)

Groups can also be assigned directly to individual assets (agents, tools, knowledge bases, or workforces). This provides granular control over who can access and use specific resources.

When adding a group to an asset, you'll assign them an [asset-level role](/get-started/enterprise/rbac#asset-level-controls) (Admin, Member, or Viewer) which determines their permissions for that specific asset.

### Adding groups to assets

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmheca16f3myjfatigr1f7k31" frameBorder="0" title="Add groups to assets" allow="clipboard-write" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

To add a group to an asset:

1. Open the asset you want to set permissions on
2. Click **Share**
3. Click **Groups**
4. Choose the group you want to add
5. Set the permission for the group (Admin, Member, or Viewer)

<Info>
  If a group is not already part of the asset's parent project, adding it to the asset will automatically add all group members to the project as well.
</Info>

## How Group Synchronization Works

RBAC Groups maintains synchronization with your identity provider to ensure access control stays current with your organizational structure.

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Hourly Sync" icon="clock">
    Groups automatically sync from your IDP every 60 minutes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Login Refresh" icon="arrow-right-to-bracket">
    Group membership refreshes when users log in via SSO (if group claims are present)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Background Processing" icon="gears">
    Syncs happen automatically without user intervention
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Adding users to groups

When a user is added to an IDP group:

1. The change is detected during the next sync (within 60 minutes) or on their next SSO login
2. The user automatically gains access to all projects and assets assigned to that group
3. The user inherits the group's role and permissions for each resource
4. No manual intervention is required in Relevance AI

### Removing users from groups

When a user is removed from an IDP group:

1. The change is detected during the next sync or on login
2. The user's group-based access to projects and assets is revoked
3. If the user has individual (direct) permissions, those are retained
4. If the user only had group-based access, they lose access to the resource

<Warning>
  Users removed from IDP groups lose their group-based permissions immediately upon sync. Ensure you understand the impact before removing users from groups in your identity provider.
</Warning>

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I access RBAC Groups without upgrading to Enterprise?">
    No. RBAC Groups is available for Enterprise subscriptions only.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Which identity providers are supported?">
    RBAC Groups supports major identity providers including Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) and Okta through WorkOS. For a complete list of supported providers, see the [WorkOS integrations documentation](https://workos.com/docs/integrations).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I assign different roles to the same group at different levels?">
    Yes. A group can have different roles at the project level versus the asset level. For example, a group could be Members at the project level but Admins on a specific agent within that project.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if a user is in multiple groups with different roles?">
    If a user belongs to multiple groups assigned to the same resource with different roles, they receive the highest permission level among all their group memberships and individual assignments.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use RBAC Groups with non-SSO users?">
    RBAC Groups requires users to authenticate via SSO through your identity provider. Users who sign in with email/password or other non-SSO methods cannot be managed through IDP groups.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between RBAC and RBAC Groups?">
    RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) provides the permission framework and roles at organization, project, and asset levels. RBAC Groups extends this by allowing you to assign those roles to entire groups of users at once, rather than individually.
