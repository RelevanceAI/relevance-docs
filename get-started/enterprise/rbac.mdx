<Warning>
  RBAC is gradually being rolled out to our Enterprise customers. If you have an Enterprise subscription with Relevance AI and do not have access to this feature yet, please reach out to your sales representative to share your interest in this feature.

  You will not be able to access this feature if you are not on an Enterprise subscription.
</Warning>

Role-based access controls (RBAC) in Relevance AI is a security and governance feature that allows organizations to manage user access based on predefined roles and responsibilities. It ensures that individuals only have access to the data, tools, and platform functions necessary for their role, supporting operational control, collaboration, and compliance across teams.

These new controls are designed to enhance security for our Enterprise clients by providing granular permissions at different levels.

There are three main levels: org-level roles (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer), project-level roles (Admin, Editor, Member, Chat, Viewer), and asset-level roles (Admin, Member, Viewer).

Each role has specific permissions that dictate what users can do within the platform, such as managing credits, using agents, accessing integrations, and using Chat.

This means you can tailor access based on the needs of your team, ensuring that sensitive information and functionalities are only available to those who need them.

## Best Practices

Keep permissions simple. Assign roles based on who needs to build, who needs to view, who needs to chat, and who needs to govern.

### Organization Level

- **Admins** — set up and manage teams, projects, and authentication. Usually your workspace or IT leads.
- **Members** — have autonomy to create their own projects and assets. Best for power users or builders.
- **Viewers** — should not create anything until they're assigned to a project. Use this for early access or external collaborators.

### Project Level

- **Admins** — own the project setup and governance. They control permission and authentication accounts.
- **Editors** — build, edit, and run all assets in the project. Treat them as your core contributors.
- **Members** — can build their own assets but don't automatically see or edit others'. Great for independent work within shared projects.
- **Chat** — access [Relevance Chat](/chat/intro-to-chat) only, cannot access the web app. Perfect for users who only need to interact with agents through chat. Requires asset-level permissions to run specific agents.
- **Viewers** — can't build or edit. Add them only to the specific assets they need to see.

<Tip>Keep admin/editor access limited to people actively managing or building. Everyone else should be a member or viewer by default.</Tip>

### Asset Level

- Project admins and editors automatically have full control.
- Members can run assets but can't modify them unless granted edit rights.
- Viewers can only see results or outputs — they can't run or trigger anything.

<Tip>Default to least privilege. Grant edit rights intentionally, not by habit.</Tip>

## Organization level controls

New organization members will be given viewer permissions by default. If invited, their role will be selected during invite.

### Chat Role Details

<Warning>
  The Chat role is a new feature being gradually rolled out to Enterprise customers. If you have an Enterprise subscription with Relevance AI and do not have access to this feature yet, please reach out to your sales representative to share your interest in this feature.
</Warning>

The **Chat** role is designed for users who only need to interact with AI agents through [Relevance Chat](/chat/intro-to-chat) without accessing the main web application. Key characteristics:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Controlled agent visibility">
    Chat role users can only see and run agents they have Member or higher permissions on. They won't be able to see any other agents in Chat. This allows you to control exactly which agents each Chat user can access by assigning asset-level permissions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Chat-only access">
    Users with this role are automatically redirected to Chat and cannot access the web app.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No asset creation">
    Cannot create new agents, tools, or knowledge bases.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="LLM conversations">
    Can have conversations with LLMs and in-built Chat Agents directly without agents.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="More powerful than Viewer">
    Can trigger Chat and interact with agents (with proper asset permissions).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Less powerful than Member">
    Cannot create assets or access the web app.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

This role is ideal for end users, external collaborators, or team members who only need to use pre-built agents through the chat interface.

## Asset level controls

An asset is an Agent, Tool, Knowledge or Workforce.

Upon asset creation, the creator becomes the admin. An asset can have multiple admins (project admin is by default).

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I access role-based access controls without upgrading to Enterprise?">No. This feature is available for Enterprise subscriptions only.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I'm on an Enterprise subscription but do not have access to this feature yet. How do I get access?">This feature is gradually being rolled out to Enterprise customers. Please reach out to your sales representative to express your interest in receiving this feature.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I limit someone to only access Chat?">To limit a user to only access [Relevance Chat](/chat/intro-to-chat), assign them the **Chat** role at the project level.
