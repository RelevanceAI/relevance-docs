<Warning>
  RBAC is gradually being rolled out to our Enterprise customers. If you have an Enterprise subscription with Relevance AI and do not have access to this feature yet, please reach out to your sales representative to share your interest in this feature.

  You will not be able to access this feature if you are not on an Enterprise subscription.
</Warning>

Role-based access controls (RBAC) in Relevance AI is a security and governance feature that allows organisations to manage user access based on predefined roles and responsibilities. It ensures that individuals only have access to the data, tools, and platform functions necessary for their role, supporting operational control, collaboration, and compliance across teams.

These new controls are designed to enhance security for our Enterprise clients by providing granular permissions at different levels.

There are three main levels: org-level roles (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer), project-level roles (Admin, Editor, Member, Viewer), and asset-level roles (Admin, Member, Viewer).

Each role has specific permissions that dictate what users can do within the platform, such as managing credits, using agents, and accessing integrations.

This means you can tailor access based on the needs of your team, ensuring that sensitive information and functionalities are only available to those who need them.

## Organization level controls

New organization members will be given viewer permissions by default. If invited, their role will be selected during invite.
