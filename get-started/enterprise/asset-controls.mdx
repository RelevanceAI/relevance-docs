<Warning>
  Asset-level authentication controls are gradually being rolled out to our Enterprise customers. If you have an Enterprise subscription with Relevance AI and do not have access to this feature yet, please reach out to your sales representative to share your interest in this feature.

  You will not be able to access this feature if you are not on an Enterprise subscription.
</Warning>

Asset-level authentication controls allow users to decide whether they wish to share their OAuth accounts with other users on their assets or not. Users can set their OAuth accounts to be shared (accessible and used by other users of the asset), or hidden from other users.
