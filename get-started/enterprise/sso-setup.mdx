Single Sign-On (SSO) enables your organization to authenticate users through your identity provider, providing centralized access control, enhanced security, and a seamless login experience.

## Supported Identity Providers

Relevance AI supports SSO through the following identity providers:

- **Okta**
- **Azure AD / Microsoft Entra ID** 
- **Google Workspace**

All SSO integrations use industry-standard SAML 2.0 protocols via WorkOS.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up SSO, ensure you have:

- Your organization's email domain
- IT admin contact at your organization
