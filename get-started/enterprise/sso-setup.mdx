## Prerequisites

Before setting up SSO, ensure you have:

- Your organization's email domain
- IT admin contact at your organization
- Admin access to your identity provider

<Warning>
Setting up SSO requires coordination between your Relevance AI representative and your IT administrator. Plan to have your IT admin available during setup.
</Warning>

## Setup Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact Your Relevance AI Representative" icon="handshake">
    Reach out to your Relevance AI representative to initiate SSO setup. Provide:
    
    - Your organization's email domain
    - Contact information for your IT administrator
    - Your preferred identity provider (e.g., Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, Auth0, or others)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive Setup Link" icon="envelope">
    Your IT administrator will receive an email with a setup link and instructions for completing the SSO configuration through WorkOS.
    
    <Info>
    Your IT admin should refer to the WorkOS integration guide for your specific identity provider. Visit [WorkOS Integrations](https://workos.com/docs/integrations) and select your provider for detailed setup instructions. Don't worry if you select the wrong one - the configuration can be redone.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete SSO Configuration" icon="gear">
    Your IT administrator will:
    
    1. Click the setup link provided in the email
    2. Complete the SSO configuration through the WorkOS interface
    3. Follow the WorkOS process: [Using Admin Portal](https://workos.com/docs/admin-portal/c-using-admin-portal)
    
    <Warning>
    **Important:** When clicking the setup link, your IT admin will be directed to your organization's WorkOS environment (created by Relevance AI). They should **not** create a new WorkOS account. If they see a billing screen or are prompted to pay, they are in the wrong organization. Contact your Relevance AI representative if this occurs.
    </Warning>
    
    <Note>
    Admin permissions in your identity provider are required to complete this step.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test SSO Connection" icon="vial">
    Your IT administrator should test the SSO connection to ensure it works properly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign User Access" icon="users">
    Your IT administrator will assign SSO access to the requested users in your identity provider system.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Setup" icon="check">

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does SSO setup take?">
    The setup process typically takes 30-60 minutes once your IT administrator receives the setup link.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What is WorkOS?">
    WorkOS is the SSO infrastructure provider that handles the secure connection between Relevance AI and your identity provider. You don't need a WorkOS account - your IT admin will use it only during the setup process. When your IT admin clicks the setup link, they'll be directed to your organization's WorkOS environment that Relevance AI has already created. They should not see any billing screens or be prompted to create a new account.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use multiple identity providers?">
    No, each Relevance AI organization can only connect to one identity provider at a time. Contact your sales representative if you need to discuss alternative options.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if I need to change identity providers?">
    Contact your Relevance AI representative. They will coordinate disabling your current SSO configuration and setting up a new one with your new identity provider.
