This guide explains how to configure streaming events from Relevance to your own S3 bucket for audit logs and business intelligence analytics.

<Note>We currently only support S3 buckets as blob stores for streaming events.</Note>

Streaming events provide detailed audit logs and business intelligence data about platform usage, executions, and system events. These events are automatically streamed to your S3 bucket in a structured format for analysis and compliance reporting.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account permissions to create policies and S3 buckets
- A Relevance AI account on the Enterprise plan

## Instructions

### 1. Create an S3 bucket

Create an S3 bucket in the same region where your Relevance data is stored. Use the following region mapping:

- **Australia**: `ap-southeast-2` (Sydney)
- **Europe**: `eu-west-2` (London)
- **US**: `us-east-1` (N. Virginia)

<Warning>Ensure the bucket is created in the correct region.</Warning>

### 2. Add Bucket policy

Add the following policy statement to your bucket policy. You'll need to customize the placeholders:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowRelevanceEventConsumer",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "RELEVANCE_EVENT_CONSUMER_ROLE_ARN"
      },
      "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME",
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace the following placeholders in the policy:
- **`YOUR_BUCKET_NAME`**: Replace with your actual S3 bucket name in both the Resource ARNs
- **`RELEVANCE_EVENT_CONSUMER_ROLE_ARN`**: Replace with Relevance's IAM role ARN for your region

<Note>The IAM role ARN is region-specific. Contact your Relevance team for this.</Note>

### 3. Provide Configuration Information

Once your S3 bucket is configured, provide your Account Manager or our support team with the following information:

1. **Bucket Name**: The name of your S3 bucket
2. **Region**: The AWS region where your bucket is located
3. **Prefix**: The S3 prefix where you want events to be stored (e.g., `relevance-events/`)

## Event Structure

Once configured, events will start flowing into your bucket under the specified prefix. The folder structure follows this pattern:

```
YOUR_PREFIX/
├── event_type/
│   └── dt=YYYY-MM-DD/
│       └── unique_id.gz
```
### Example Structure

```

```

### Event Types

- **`billing_events`**: Usage and billing-related events
- **`execution_event`**: Execution and performance events
- **`i_a_m_event`**: Identity and access management events
- **`asset_event`**: Asset creation, modification, and deletion events

### File Format

- All event files are stored as **gzip-compressed** json objects
- The `dt=` parameter uses **UTC date format** (YYYY-MM-DD)
- File names follow the pattern: `event-consumer-{event-type}-{environment}-{instance}-{timestamp}-{uuid}.gz`
- Each file contains a unique identifier (UUID) to prevent conflicts
