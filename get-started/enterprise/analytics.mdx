## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Analytics">
    Navigate to **Account** in your Relevance AI dashboard and click on **Analytics**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Your Filters">
    Select your date range and choose which agents to analyze
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore Your Data">
    Scroll through the dashboard to explore workforce, agent, and action breakdowns
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>**Pro tip:** Scroll to the bottom of any breakdown table to see summary stats like "Avg: 0.36% error rate" and "Avg: 95 credits/task"—these give you instant performance benchmarks without reviewing individual rows.</Tip>

## Key Metrics at a Glance

Your Analytics dashboard displays four critical metrics with trend comparisons:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Tasks" icon="list-check">
    Total tasks completed by your agents with percentage change trends
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tasks to Review" icon="eye">
    Tasks awaiting human approval or review
  </Card>
  <Card title="Actions Used" icon="bolt">
    Number of tool executions and API calls made by your agents
  </Card>
  <Card title="Credits Used" icon="coins">
    Total Relevance AI credits consumed across all activities
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Each metric shows percentage change from the previous period. For example, "+45.78%" on Tasks means you completed 45% more tasks than the previous period—use this to track growth or identify sudden increases in workload.

<Note>**Filter and Focus**: Click the date range picker (top right) to select custom time periods. Use "All agents" dropdown to view individual agent performance. Compare October vs September to track month-over-month growth, or select a specific agent to see only their metrics across all charts and tables.</Note>

## Dashboard Sections

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Task and Action Trends" icon="chart-line">
    Interactive charts show your daily task volume and action usage over time. 
    
    **Quickly identify:**
    - **Peak usage days** - Spot which days have the highest bars to understand demand patterns
    - **Unusual activity patterns** - Look for unexpected spikes or drops that might indicate issues
    - **Growth trends** - See if bars are generally increasing (growth) or decreasing (reduced usage)
    
    **How to use it:** Hover over any bar to see exact numbers for that day. Use the date range picker to zoom into specific weeks or months. Compare task volume with credit usage charts to understand cost patterns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Credits" icon="coins">
    A dedicated chart showing your daily credit consumption over time.
    
    **Quickly identify:**
    - **Expensive days** - See which days consumed the most credits (highest bars)
    - **Cost anomalies** - Spot unexpected credit spikes that might indicate workflows using excessive credits
    - **Spending patterns** - Understand if your credit usage is steady, growing, or fluctuating
    
    **How to use it:** Hover over bars to see exact credit amounts for each day. Compare the Credits chart with the Tasks chart above it—if tasks are flat but credits spike, you have workflows becoming more expensive. Use this to budget and forecast monthly credit needs based on historical patterns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Workforce Breakdown" icon="users-gear">
    See performance metrics for each of your AI workforces:
    
    | Metric | What It Shows |
    |--------|---------------|
    | **Workforce Tasks** | Tasks handled by the workforce |
    | **Agent Tasks** | Individual agent activities within the workforce |
    | **Error Rate** | Percentage of failed tasks |
    | **Actions & Credits** | Resource consumption per workforce |
    | **Credits/Task** | Cost efficiency metric |
    
    **How to use it:** Compare Credits/Task across workforces to find your most cost-effective teams. Click into any workforce row to see more details. Check the summary stats at the bottom (e.g., "Avg: 95 credits/task") to gauge overall performance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent Breakdown" icon="robot">
    Drill down to individual agent performance:
    
    | Metric | What It Tells You |
    |--------|-------------------|
    | **Tasks** | Volume of work handled |
    | **Error Rate** | Reliability and success rate |
    | **Actions/Task** | Complexity indicator (more actions = more complex workflows) |
    | **Credits/Task** | Cost per task for efficiency comparison |
    
    **How to use it:** Sort by Credits/Task to find your most efficient agents (e.g., agent with 5 credits/task vs 3,500 credits/task). Use "Show 35 more agents" to view your full agent list. Investigate agents with high error rates or unusually high Actions/Task ratios.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Action Breakdown" icon="bolt">
    See which specific tools and integrations are being used:
    
    | Metric | Purpose |
    |--------|---------|
    | **Executions** | How often each action is called |
    | **Error Rate** | Action reliability and integration health |
    | **Tasks** | Number of tasks using this action |
    | **Credits/Exec** | Cost per execution |
    
    **How to use it:** Check which actions have high execution counts to see your most-used tools. Actions with 0.00% error rates are working reliably. If an action shows error rates above 0%, investigate that integration. Sort by Credits/Exec to find expensive API calls or tool executions.
  </Accordion>

## Why Use Analytics?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cost Control" icon="chart-line-down">
    Monitor the Credits Used metric and watch for percentage spikes. Compare Credits/Task across agents to find expensive workflows and optimize them
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Performance Optimization" icon="gauge-high">
    Sort agents by Credits/Task in the Agent Breakdown table. Agents with lower credits per task are more efficient—study their setup to replicate success
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Error Monitoring" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Check the Error % column in each breakdown table. Sort by error rate to quickly identify which agents or actions are failing and need attention
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Capacity Planning" icon="arrow-trend-up">
    Use the date range filter to compare different periods. Watch for consistent upward trends in the task chart and high percentage changes to identify when you need more agents
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="ROI Visibility" icon="chart-pie">
    Point stakeholders to the Tasks metric showing volume completed and Credits/Task showing cost efficiency. The summary stats at table bottoms provide quick proof of value
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Troubleshooting" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    Look for unusual spikes in the charts, high error rates in tables, or agents with abnormally high Credits/Task ratios to catch issues early
  </Card>
