    [View integration controls guide →](/get-started/enterprise/integration-controls)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up API Key Management (Optional)" icon="code">
    **Why this matters**: Organization and project-level API keys allow you to centrally manage credentials for integrations, ensuring consistent authentication across your teams and simplifying key rotation.
    
    **What you'll do**:
    - Configure organization-level API keys for company-wide integrations
    - Set project-level API keys to override organization defaults when needed
    - Understand key precedence (project-level overrides organization-level)
    
    **Time required**: 10-15 minutes
    
    <Info>
    **Feature Status**: Organization and project-level API keys are gradually being rolled out to Enterprise customers. Contact your sales representative to enable this feature.
    </Info>
    
    <Note>
    If you set an API key at the organization level, all projects will use it unless a project-level key is specified. Project-level keys always take precedence over organization-level keys.
    </Note>

## Best Practices for Enterprise Deployment

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Security First">
    ### Configure Security Before Inviting Users
    
    Set up SSO and RBAC before inviting your entire organization. This ensures users have appropriate access from day one and prevents security gaps during onboarding.
    
    **Initial security setup**
    
    Complete SSO setup and test with a pilot group before enforcing it organization-wide. Configure organization and project-level roles thoughtfully, ensuring that sensitive resources have additional asset-level permissions.
    
    **Multi-factor authentication**
    
    Work with your identity provider team to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an additional security layer. This is especially important for Admin and Owner roles.
    
    **The cost of shortcuts**
    
    The security foundation you build now will scale with your organization. Taking shortcuts during initial setup often leads to security remediation work later, which is more disruptive and time-consuming than getting it right from the start.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Scale with Groups">
    ### Use Directory Sync for Teams of 20+
    
    If you have more than 20 users, use Directory Sync and Groups instead of managing individual user permissions. This approach saves time, reduces errors, and scales effortlessly as your organization grows.
    
    **Leverage existing structure**
    
    Enable Directory Sync with your identity provider and organize users into logical groups based on your existing structure—whether by team, department, or function. Assign entire groups to projects instead of managing hundreds of individual users.
    
    **Automatic synchronization**
    
    This approach leverages the organizational structure you've already built in your identity provider and keeps access control synchronized automatically. When someone joins the Marketing team in your IDP, they automatically get access to Marketing projects in Relevance AI.
    
    **Naming conventions matter**
    
    Document your group naming conventions early. As your deployment grows, consistent naming makes it easy for project admins to find and assign the right groups. The time invested in setting up Directory Sync properly pays dividends as your organization scales.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Plan Structure">
    ### Design Before You Build
    
    Take time to plan your organization structure before creating projects and assets. Restructuring later is more difficult than getting it right from the start.
    
    **Start with strategy**
    
    Map out your project structure before creating anything in Relevance AI. Decide whether to organize by team, use case, environment, or a hybrid approach. Establish clear naming conventions for projects and assets, and define ownership models.
    
    **Think ahead**
    
    Consider both your current needs and how you expect the platform to grow over the next 12-24 months. Will you need separate production and development environments? How will you handle shared resources? Where will experimental work live?
    
    **Organize within projects**
    
    Plan folder structures within projects to keep assets organized. A well-designed structure makes it easier to manage permissions, track usage, and scale operations as adoption grows.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Access Control">
    ### Follow Least Privilege Principle
    
    Grant users the minimum permissions they need to do their work. You can always expand access later, but restricting access after the fact is harder and may disrupt workflows.
    
    **Start restrictive, expand as needed**
    
    Start by assigning users to the Viewer role and escalate permissions based on demonstrated need. Use project-level permissions as your default access control mechanism, adding asset-level permissions only for sensitive resources that require additional restrictions.
    
    **Careful with admin access**
    
    Assign project Admin roles carefully—typically just one or two people per project who are responsible for managing that project's resources and access. Too many admins create confusion about ownership and accountability.
    
    **Regular audits**
    
    Regularly audit permissions during growth phases, especially when teams reorganize or people change roles. The principle of least privilege isn't just about security—it also reduces confusion by ensuring users only see the resources relevant to their work.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Governance">
    ### Establish Clear Policies
    
    Create and document governance policies before scaling your deployment. This prevents confusion, ensures consistency, and helps maintain security standards.
    
    **Document your rules**
    
    Document who can create projects, what approval processes exist for new integrations, and how teams should name their projects and assets. Establish regular permission audits—quarterly is a good starting point—and create clear workflows for requesting access.
    
    **Enable, don't block**
    
    Good governance doesn't mean slowing teams down. It means providing clear guidelines that help teams move quickly while maintaining security and compliance. When people know the rules and understand why they exist, they're more likely to follow them.
    
    **Make it accessible**
    
    Share your policies in a central location that's easy to find and update them as your deployment evolves. Consider creating a dedicated project or knowledge base for governance documentation.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Pilot & Monitor">
    ### Test with a Pilot Team
    
    Before rolling out to your entire organization, test your setup with a small pilot team (5-10 users). This helps you identify issues and refine your configuration without impacting everyone.
    
    **Choose diverse pilot users**
    
    Select pilot users from different teams and use cases to get diverse feedback. Test SSO login flows thoroughly, verify that permissions work as expected, and ensure usage monitoring is capturing the data you need.
    
    **Set up monitoring early**
    
    Set up usage alerts during the pilot so you can understand consumption patterns before opening access widely. This helps you set realistic usage limits and identify potential cost issues before they become problems.
    
    **Learn and iterate**
    
    Gather feedback from pilot users about what's working and what's confusing. Use this input to refine your setup, update documentation, and improve onboarding materials. Monitor usage patterns closely for the first 30 days after full rollout—this is when you'll learn the most about how your organization uses the platform.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does Enterprise setup take?">
    Most organizations complete the core setup (Steps 1-5) in 2-3 hours. The optional steps (S3 streaming, integration controls) add another 30-60 minutes. If you're planning your organization structure carefully, allow additional time for that planning phase.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I skip steps in the recommended order?">
    While you can technically skip steps, we strongly recommend following the order. SSO and Directory Sync should always come first, as they affect how users access the platform. Skipping these steps may require you to reconfigure access later, which can disrupt your users.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I don't have an identity provider?">
    Enterprise features require an identity provider (Okta, Azure AD/Entra ID, or Google Workspace). If you don't have one, you'll need to set one up before using SSO and Directory Sync features. Most organizations already have an IDP for email and other services.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I get help during setup?">
    Enterprise customers have access to dedicated support. Contact your sales representative or [reach out to our support team](/get-started/support) via your Slack channel or other support methods. We can also provide setup assistance for complex deployments.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if I don't complete all setup steps?">
    You can use Relevance AI without completing all steps, but you won't have full Enterprise security and governance capabilities. We recommend completing at least Steps 1-4 (SSO, Directory Sync, Organization Structure, and RBAC) for a secure deployment.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I need Directory Sync if I only have a small team?">
    For teams under 20 users, Directory Sync is optional but still recommended. Manual user management works fine for small teams, but Directory Sync makes it easier to scale and ensures your access control stays in sync with your organization's identity provider.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use Relevance AI without SSO?">
    Yes, but it's not recommended for Enterprise customers. SSO provides centralized access control, enhanced security, and is required for features like Directory Sync. For Enterprise deployments, SSO should be considered essential.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
