## Understanding credits

Relevance provides a variety of plans enabling you to choose the best option according to your needs.

Each plan supports a certain number of users, credits per execution, specific data size and certain Large Language Models.

Below is a brief overview of the available plans and their specification.

For the most updated list, please visit Relevance AI's [pricing](https://relevanceai.com/pricing) page.

<Note>It is always possible to upgrade or downgrade your plan based on your usage and workload!</Note>

## Base credits costs

The base cost for running any tool or agent is 4 credits. However, this cost varies depending on your plan.

| Plan       | Credits per run |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Free       | 4               |
| Pro        | 4               |
| Team       | 3               |
| Business   | 2               |
| Enterprise | 2               |

### What affects total credit cost?

Your total credit consumption depends on several factors:

#### Tool steps

- When using integrations without your own API key, additional credits are charged since you're using our API keys.
- If you provide your own API key, no additional credits are charged for integrations.

#### Large Language Model selection

- Different models have different credit costs.
- Specific costs can be found in the `model` selector within the platform.

#### Knowledge sync

- Knowledge is our RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) solution that enables you to provide additional context to your agents and tools.
- When syncing knowledge, yourdata is vectorized to enable search capabilities.
- Knowledge sync operations have the same base credit cost as a tool run.

## Credit allocation and reset

### Reset schedule

- **Free Plan:** Credits reset daily.
- **Paid Plans:** Credits reset monthly.

### Purchasing additional credits

- Only available for paid plan users (because on a free plan credits reset daily).
- Extra credits do not roll over to the next billing cycle.
- When a new cycle begins, credits reset to your plan's default amount.
- Pricing: 1000 credits = \$2USD
- Minimum purchase: 4000 credits (\$4USD)
  - This minimum exists due to Stripe transaction fees.

Here is how you can manage your plan and purchase credits:

## Cancelling your subscription

You can cancel your Relevance AI subscription at any time by following this tutorial:

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    position: 'relative',
    paddingTop: '56.25%',
  }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmaypwh9o8hb9ho3rmx2lo1j6"
    frameBorder="0"
    title="How to cancel your subscription in Relevance AI"
    allow="clipboard-write"
    webkitallowfullscreen="true"
    mozallowfullscreen="true"
    allowfullscreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%',
      border: '3px solid #5E43CE',
      borderRadius: '10px',
    }}/>
</div>

1. To start, click the 'Manage plan' section at the bottom of the platform while logged into Relevance AI
2. Click on 'Cancel subscription'
3. On the pop-up that opens, click 'Cancel subscription' _again_ to make sure the cancellation goes through
4. You should then be directed to a pop-up confirming that you've cancelled successfully

If the platform doesn't confirm that you've cancelled successfully, please try again, then **contact support** to ensure that your cancellation has gone through and you will not be billed.

If the platform has confirmed your cancellation is successful, you do not need to reach out to our support team. 

Once you cancel, you'll still have access to your upgraded features until your next renewal date. You will not have your subscription immediately cancelled, and your latest payment will not be refunded. If you have any further questions about cancellation, please [reach out to our support team](https://relevanceai.com/docs/get-started/support).

## Invoices and receipts

Invoices and receipts for payment will be sent to the user at your company who purchased the subscription / credits at the time of purchase. You'll also be sent a receipt / invoice at every renewal. 

However, if you need to get a new invoice / receipt, or find invoices / receipts in the platform, please follow these steps:

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    position: 'relative',
    paddingTop: '56.25%',
