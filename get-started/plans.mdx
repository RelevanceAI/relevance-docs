## Understanding credits

Relevance provides a variety of plans enabling you to choose the best option according to your needs.

Each plan supports a certain number of users, credits per execution, specific data size and certain Large Language Models.

Below is a brief overview of the available plans and their specification.

For the most updated list, please visit Relevance AI's [pricing](https://relevanceai.com/pricing) page.

<Note>
  It is always possible to upgrade or downgrade your plan based on your usage and workload\!
</Note>

### Base credits costs

The base cost for running any tool or agent is 4 credits. However, this cost varies depending on your plan.

| Plan       | Credits per run |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Free       | 4               |
| Pro        | 4               |
| Team       | 3               |
| Business   | 2               |
| Enterprise | 2               |

### How many credits do I have left?

You can view how many credits you have left in the bottom left of Relevance AI. The credits counter will show you a total of the **number of credits you have left remaining** over the **number of credits you receive in your plan per month / year** (or day if you're a free user).

The color of the counter also indicates how many credits you have remaining based on how many you have in your billing period. If your counter is green, this means you're in a good position\! If the counter turns red, you should consider adding more credits if you think you're going to run out before your next renewal, or consider upgrading to a higher plan in the future.

For example, in the image above, this user is on a Team plan, billed monthly. They currently receive 100,000 credits per month, and have 75,500 left. They have 14 days left, and are in a good position to continue using Relevance AI until their next renewal period.

### What affects total credit cost?

Your total credit consumption depends on several factors:

#### Tool steps

- When using integrations without your own API key, additional credits are charged since you're using our API keys.
- If you provide your own API key, no additional credits are charged for integrations.

#### Large Language Model selection

- Different models have different credit costs.
- Specific costs can be found in the `model` selector within the platform.

#### Knowledge sync

- Knowledge is our RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) solution that enables you to provide additional context to your agents and tools.
- When syncing knowledge, yourdata is vectorized to enable search capabilities.
- Knowledge sync operations have the same base credit cost as a tool run.

### Credit allocation and reset

#### Reset schedule

- **Free Plan:** Credits reset daily at midnight, Sydney time (AEST / AEDT)
- **Paid Plans:** Credits reset at your next renewal date

### Purchasing additional credits

If you have a paid plan, you can purchase extra credits to use before your next renewal if you run out.

If you purchase these extra credits, **please note that these do not roll over to the next billing cycle**. You will sacrifice your credits at your next renewal date, and your credits will reset to your plan's default amount.

The minimum amount of credits you can purchase is 10000 credits (\$20 USD).

### Monitoring credit usage

To check your credit consumption:

1. Click 'Settings' in the sidebar
2. Navigate to Plan & Billing.

<Warning>
  You'll only have access to this section if you are an admin of your Organization.
</Warning>

4. You should then be directed to a pop-up confirming that you've cancelled successfully

If the platform doesn't confirm that you've cancelled successfully, please try again, then **contact support** to ensure that your cancellation has gone through and you will not be billed.

If the platform has confirmed your cancellation is successful, you do not need to reach out to our support team.

Once you cancel, you'll still have access to your upgraded features until your next renewal date. You will not have your subscription immediately cancelled, and your latest payment will not be refunded. If you have any further questions about cancellation, please [reach out to our support team](https://relevanceai.com/docs/get-started/support).

## Invoices and receipts

Invoices and receipts for payment will be sent to the user at your company who purchased the subscription / credits at the time of purchase. You'll also be sent a receipt / invoice at every renewal.

However, if you need to get a new invoice / receipt, or find invoices / receipts in the platform, please follow these steps:

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative",paddingTop:"56.25%" }}>

4. This will open our payment system's page. On this page, scroll down to 'Invoice History' and click the payment you want to get an invoice for
5. On the page that opens, click 'Download invoice' or 'Download receipt' based on the document you need

If you need to change the name of your company on your invoice / receipt, please [reach out to our support team](https://relevanceai.com/docs/get-started/support). The easiest way to do this would be to forward your latest invoice to [support@relevanceai.com](mailto:support@relevanceai.com).

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I've accidentally upgraded with annual billing, but I meant to upgrade with monthly billing. How do I change to monthly billing going forward?">
    Unfortunately if you change in platform, this change will only be put into place at your next renewal date in a year.

    If you want to change to monthly billing immediately, you'll need to [reach out to our support team](https://relevanceai.com/docs/get-started/support).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I've just renewed but it's showing that I've already used all of my credits?">
    Check your credit counter to make sure you've read this correctly. Your credits counter will show you **the number of credits you have left to use**, not the number of credits you've used.

    If your counter is showing 10100 credits over 10000, for instance, this means you have 10100 credits left to use in your current billing period, not that you've used 10100 credits.
