## Understanding credits

Relevance provides a variety of plans enabling you to choose the best option according to your needs.

Each plan supports a certain number of users, credits per execution, specific data size and certain Large Language Models.

Below is a brief overview of the available plans and their specification.

For the most updated list, please visit Relevance AI's [pricing](https://relevanceai.com/pricing) page.

<Note>It is always possible to upgrade or downgrade your plan based on your usage and workload!</Note>

## Base credits costs

The base cost for running any tool or agent is 4 credits. However, this cost varies depending on your plan.

| Plan       | Credits per run |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Free       | 4               |
| Pro        | 4               |
| Team       | 3               |
| Business   | 2               |
| Enterprise | 2               |

### What affects total credit cost?

Your total credit consumption depends on several factors:

#### Tool steps

- When using integrations without your own API key, additional credits are charged since you're using our API keys.
- If you provide your own API key, no additional credits are charged for integrations.

#### Large Language Model selection

- Different models have different credit costs.
- Specific costs can be found in the `model` selector within the platform.

#### Knowledge sync

- Knowledge is our RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) solution that enables you to provide additional context to your agents and tools.
- When syncing knowledge, yourdata is vectorized to enable search capabilities.
- Knowledge sync operations have the same base credit cost as a tool run.

## Credit allocation and reset

### Reset schedule

- **Free Plan:** Credits reset daily.
- **Paid Plans:** Credits reset monthly.

### Purchasing additional credits

- Only available for paid plan users (because on a free plan credits reset daily).
- Extra credits do not roll over to the next billing cycle.
- When a new cycle begins, credits reset to your plan's default amount.
- Pricing: 1000 credits = \$2USD
- Minimum purchase: 4000 credits (\$4USD)
  - This minimum exists due to Stripe transaction fees.

Here is how you can manage your plan and purchase credits:
