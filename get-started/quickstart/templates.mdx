## What are Tools?

Tools are capabilities that you can equip your agent with, so that they can interact with external systems like the ones you use during your day-to-day workflows. Some of our most popular tools include:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Website scraping" icon="plug-circle-bolt" iconType="duotone" href="https://relevanceai.com/templates/website-scraping-5e6ae">
    Use this tool to scrape the HTML, or raw text content of a website via it's URL. You can give it scraping objectives if you want it to retrieve a specific subset of information.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Google Search" icon="plug-circle-bolt" iconType="duotone" href="https://relevanceai.com/templates/google-search">
    Get the first 10 search results in Google for a given search query, or related questions, or the People Also Asked items.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Escalate to Managers via Email" icon="plug-circle-bolt" iconType="duotone" href="https://relevanceai.com/templates/escalate-to-managers-via-email-7397d">
    Streamline the process of escalating critical issues to managers (or anyone) through email. E.g. Escalate questions that an Agent doesn't know an answer to so a human can respond.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Translate a webpage" icon="plug-circle-bolt" iconType="duotone" href="https://relevanceai.com/templates/translate-webpage-91bcc">
    Effortlessly translate entire webpages into any languages. Ideal for global businesses who want their content available to international audiences.

You can see the full list of no-code tools that are available under the agents section on our [templates page](https://relevanceai.com/templates), or within the Tools page of our platform.

## How to use Tools?

You have two options when it comes to using Tools:

1. Use a [ready-to-use tool template](https://relevanceai.com/templates) designed and maintained by Relevance.
2. Create your own custom tool from scratch.

We recommend that you follow the quickstart tutorial below for creating a tool from scratch, and using it once it has been built, in order to fully understand how to use our tool template library.

The way you define a tool is different to how you guide an agent to use a tool in practice. For example, we have a tool for checking calendar availability. It requires that dates are provided to it in a specific format, the ISO format.

![Tool Definition](/images/tool-definition.png)

However, once you give your agent access to the tool, you won't have to worry about providing dates in a specific format. Your agent will be smart enough to convert any date you give it into the correct iso format for you. The same thing happens for other input types too.

After equipping an agent with the check calendar availability tool above, I asked it to "tell me what my availability is for the rest of the week for meetings that are an hour and a half long."

![Tool usage](/images/cal-availability-nlq.png)

They were smart enough to give the tool the correct inputs for that: start date and end date in iso format, and converting hour and a half to minutes for the meeting duration input.

It also converted the timestamp list output by the tool into a human-readable way that was easy for me to understand (you can see the original output by clicking on the tool step after it has run in chat).

### Core concepts for tools

Tools have four key concepts that you need to understand to be able to unlock their full magic:

- **Knowledge**: Text.
- **User Inputs**: Text.
- **Tool chaining**: Text.
- **Running tools**: Text.

## No-code Tool Quickstart

The best way to learn how to create tools and give your agents access to them, is to build one with us. No code is required for this tutorial.

### Check calendar availability

We're going to build a tool that checks your calendar for your upcoming availability. We'll also equip an agent with that tool, then ask it something like: What is my availability like over the next 2 weeks. It will then use the tool we create to answer that question for you.

The reason we are taking you through a calendar availability tool example, is because it highlights some very powerful capabilities of AI Agents ability to reason.












## What are Tools?

Tools in Relevance are designed to be:

1. **Zero to low code**: Easily create Tools without extensive programming knowledge.
2. **Flexible**: Build custom analysis flows and workflows as desired.
3. **Customizable**: Tailor Tools to your specific use case and requirements.
4. **Accurate**: Leverage the power of LLMs for precise results.
5. **Safe and secure**: Ensure data privacy and security within the Relevance platform.
6. **Easy to maintain**: Simplify Tool management and updates.

## Creating a Tool

To create a new Tool, navigate to the [Tools](/get-started/key-concepts/tools) page and click on the `+ Create tool` button in the top right corner.

You have two options when creating a Tool:

1. Use a [ready-to-use template](/templates/introduction) designed and maintained by Relevance.
2. [Create your own custom Tool](/build-custom-tools/create-a-tool) from scratch.

<Tip>
Tools that you create are saved under the [Tools](/get-started/key-concepts/tools) menu and also listed on the [Home](/get-started/key-concepts/home) page for easy access.
</Tip>

## Building a Tool

The Tool Notebook consists of three main tabs:

1. **Use**: Provides an interface to run and test your Tool. Inputs are displayed as a form, and outputs are presented in a viewer supporting Markdown, HTML, and media.

2. **Build**: Where you create your LLM chains. Select from a library of transformations and add them as steps in the chain. Define the expected inputs, such as file or text inputs. Each step can be run individually for testing and debugging.

3. **Logs**: View the execution logs of your Tool to monitor its performance and troubleshoot any issues.

## Using a Tool

There are several ways to use an LLM-powered Tool:

1. **App**: Run the Tool directly from the Notebook interface.
2. **Run in bulk**: Process multiple inputs simultaneously.
3. **Chat**: Integrate the Tool into a conversational interface.
4. **Schedule**: Set up automated runs of the Tool at specific intervals.
5. **API**: Access the Tool programmatically through an API.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic understanding of Tools in Relevance, you can:

- Explore the [ready-to-use templates](/templates/introduction) to get started quickly.
- Learn how to [create your own custom Tool](/build-custom-tools/create-a-tool) step-by-step.
- Dive deeper into the available components and configurations for building powerful AI-driven solutions.
