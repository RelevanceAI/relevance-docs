One of the missions at Relevance is to design and maintain Chains that can be widely beneficial
across different use-cases. Such chains are available under Templates.

<Tip>You can use the templates as they are or clone them. 
Cloning makes a copy of the template in your account and you will have full permission to modify them
to better suit your needs.</Tip>

Templates are categorized based on their most frequent use-case. You can scroll on the page 
or directly go to any of the below categories:
* Featured
* Operations
* Marketing
* Research
* Sales
* Other

## How to use a chain template?
### APP: Try the chain on a play-ground
Locate the desired template and click on `Use template`. This will open the chain APP page.
APP is where you provide the required information and try the chain. Such information could be 
a file to upload, typing text or numbers, selecting values from a drop-down, etc.

For instance, `GPT on my Files` is a chain able to answer questions relevant to an input file.
![GPT on my Files](/images/templates/gpt-on-my-files/GPT-on-my-files-form.png)
The chain requires two inputs: 1) a file to look at and 2) a question to answer.
Provide the data and hit `Run once`, you will see the LLM response in a few seconds.

### Run in Bulk
Under APP, we try the chain on one data sample. It is why sometimes APP is referred to as a play-ground.
As the name suggests, Bulk run is to apply the analysis on many data entries. For instance, 
* a dataset of research findings and applying a summarization chain on every single entry
* a dataset of survey responses and applying a tagging/coding chain on every single response

To apply bulk run, you need to provide the dataset (uploading a file or using an existing dataset).
Then specify which of the chain input(s) must get loaded from the provided dataset and enter the 
other inputs on the form as done on APP.

Detailed explaination of each chain can be found under [Templates](/templates/templates).
