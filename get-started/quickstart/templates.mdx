## What are Tools?

Tools allow your agents to use your tech stack much like a human would. One of our key philosophies is that subject matter or domain experts need to be the ones to distill their skills into agents. The way we do this is through our low-code tools.

We have a library of pre-built tool templates based on the most common things our customers want to do. These include:

- [**Web Scraping**](https://relevanceai.com/templates/website-scraping-5e6ae): Scrape content from a website by providing a link to the site.
- [**Google Search**](https://relevanceai.com/templates/google-search): Get the top 10 SERPs, People Also Asked or etc for a given query.
- [**Extract data from PDFs**](https://relevanceai.com/templates/extract-data-from-pdf): Extract complex data from PDFs.
- [**Retrieve messages from Slack**](https://relevanceai.com/templates/slack-retrieve-messages-89e0a): Get recent massages from any Slack channel.

You can see a complete library of the tools we have available [here](https://relevanceai.com/templates) (scroll down to the the AI tool section).

## Create a Tool

To create a new Tool, navigate to the [Tools](/get-started/key-concepts/tools) page and click on the `+ Create tool` button in the top right corner.

You have two options when creating a Tool:

1. Use a [ready-to-use template](/templates/introduction) designed and maintained by Relevance.
2. [Create your own custom Tool](/build-custom-tools/create-a-tool) from scratch.

<Tip>
Tools that you create are saved under the [Tools](/get-started/key-concepts/tools) menu and also listed on the [Home](/get-started/key-concepts/home) page for easy access.

Below are some demos for some tools you might want to create:

## Building a Tool

The Tool Notebook consists of three main tabs:

1. **Use**: Provides an interface to run and test your Tool. Inputs are displayed as a form, and outputs are presented in a viewer supporting Markdown, HTML, and media.

2. **Build**: Where you create your LLM chains. Select from a library of transformations and add them as steps in the chain. Define the expected inputs, such as file or text inputs. Each step can be run individually for testing and debugging.

3. **Logs**: View the execution logs of your Tool to monitor its performance and troubleshoot any issues.

## Using a Tool

There are several ways to use an LLM-powered Tool:

1. **App**: Run the Tool directly from the Notebook interface.
2. **Run in bulk**: Process multiple inputs simultaneously.
3. **Chat**: Integrate the Tool into a conversational interface.
4. **Schedule**: Set up automated runs of the Tool at specific intervals.
5. **API**: Access the Tool programmatically through an API.
