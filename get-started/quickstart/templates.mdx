## What are Tools?

Tools in Relevance are designed to be:

1. **Zero to low code**: Easily create Tools without extensive programming knowledge.
2. **Flexible**: Build custom analysis flows and workflows as desired.
3. **Customizable**: Tailor Tools to your specific use case and requirements.
4. **Accurate**: Leverage the power of LLMs for precise results.
5. **Safe and secure**: Ensure data privacy and security within the Relevance platform.
6. **Easy to maintain**: Simplify Tool management and updates.

## Creating a Tool

To create a new Tool, navigate to the [Tools](/get-started/key-concepts/tools) page and click on the `+ Create tool` button in the top right corner.

You have two options when creating a Tool:

1. Use a [ready-to-use template](/templates/introduction) designed and maintained by Relevance.
2. [Create your own custom Tool](/build-custom-tools/create-a-tool) from scratch.

<Tip>
Tools that you create are saved under the [Tools](/get-started/key-concepts/tools) menu and also listed on the [Home](/get-started/key-concepts/home) page for easy access.

## Building a Tool

The Tool Notebook consists of three main tabs:

1. **Use**: Provides an interface to run and test your Tool. Inputs are displayed as a form, and outputs are presented in a viewer supporting Markdown, HTML, and media.

2. **Build**: Where you create your LLM chains. Select from a library of transformations and add them as steps in the chain. Define the expected inputs, such as file or text inputs. Each step can be run individually for testing and debugging.

3. **Logs**: View the execution logs of your Tool to monitor its performance and troubleshoot any issues.

## Using a Tool

There are several ways to use an LLM-powered Tool:

1. **App**: Run the Tool directly from the Notebook interface.
2. **Run in bulk**: Process multiple inputs simultaneously.
3. **Chat**: Integrate the Tool into a conversational interface.
4. **Schedule**: Set up automated runs of the Tool at specific intervals.
5. **API**: Access the Tool programmatically through an API.
