One of the missions at Relevance is to design and maintain Tools that can be widely beneficial
across different use-cases. Such Tools are available under Templates.
![Home page](/images/templates/templates-page.png)

<Tip>You can use the templates as they are or clone them. 
Cloning makes a copy of the template in your account and you will have full permission to modify them
so the result better suits your needs.</Tip>

Templates are categorized based on their most frequent use-case(s). You can scroll down on the page 
or directly go to any of the below categories:
* Featured
* Operations
* Marketing
* Research
* Sales
* Other

## How to use a template?
### APP: Try the template on a play-ground
Locate the desired template and click on `Use template`. This will open the Tool's APP page.
APP is where you provide the required information and try the Tool. Such information could be 
a file to upload, typing text or numbers, selecting values from a drop-down, etc.

For instance, `GPT on my Files` is a Tool able to answer questions relevant to an input file.
![GPT on my Files](/images/templates/gpt-on-my-files/GPT-on-my-files-form.png)
The Tool requires two inputs: 1) a file to look at and 2) a question to answer.
Provide the data and hit `Run once`, you will see the LLM response in a few seconds.

### Run in Bulk
Under APP, we try the Tool on one data sample. It is why sometimes APP is referred to as a play-ground.
As the name suggests, Bulk run is to apply the analysis on many data entries. For instance, 
* a dataset of research findings and applying a summarization Tool on every single entry
* a dataset of survey responses and applying a tagging/coding Tool on every single response

To apply bulk run, you need to provide the dataset (uploading a file or using an existing dataset).
Then specify which of the Tool input(s) must get loaded from the provided dataset and enter the 
other inputs on the form as done on APP.

Detailed explanation of each Tool can be found under [Templates](/templates/introduction).
