Agents are powerful assistants that can be equipped with a variety of Skills. 
Skills such as Tools designed to target different goals and address different challenges. 
This is how with AI workforce, we expanded beyond what is traditionally possible.

<Tip>
**AI Agents are the building blocks of your future AI workforce. The AI workforce that you will build and deploy 
within Relevance.**
</Tip>

Experiment and feedback have proven that best Agents are created by domain experts. Domain expert have the 
knowledge to equip their Agents with custom Tools that are best tailored to their specific needs. 

## Creating an Agent
Creating an Agent is a simple process taking only a few minutes.
Select "Agents" from the left sidebar and click on the "+ Create Agent" button on the top right. 
This will prompt you to a page with two options 
* Build your Agent from scratch
* Use a template (i.e. most settings options are already prefilled)

For this guide, we select "Sales Rep Sean".

## Instruct your Agent

Every Agent has a resume that describes their skills and experience. For best results, it is very important to 
think through what we want from and Agent and spend enough time on the configuration step.

<Tip>
The more precise you are in the Agents configuration step, the closer the Agents' behavior will be to the desired outcome.
</Tip>

Each Agent has the following details:
- Name
- Emoji
- System prompt
- Suggested replies
- Welcome message

Sean is a sales rep so the system prompt describes the company he is working for and what he does. In this case, his job 
is to research companies and write personalized outreach emails for them. That is helpful :)

However, to take Sean to the next level we need to give him some skills to be able to achieve his goals - just like us, 
Sean would not be able to research a company without a device, the internet and google. 
Let's make sure he has the right skills for the job.

## Equip Skills

Skills are ways for Agents to interact with other systems. They can be used to perform actions, retrieve information and more. 
In Relevance, all Tools that you create can be equipped as Skills for Agents. This is extremely useful for two reasons:

1. Agents are not limited to or restricted by the available functionality on the platform; you can expand on any functionality that you desire.
2. The best Agents have skills created for them by domain experts in a specific company and a specific use case.

For example, with Sean we have Skills for enriching leads with LinkedIn, google search and web browsing to begin. Start with these and toggle 
the ones you would give permission for auto-run (i.e. if the toggle is off, Sean will ask for permission to run the Skill each time it is needed).

<Tip>
**Take action and [build your own Tools](/build-custom-tools/introduction)**:

Businesses operate in different ways. Similar to hiring a person, you want to onboard your Agents on your specific ways, to your specific Tools.
So while benefiting from having a community where you can share and use templates from other members, get started with customizing Tools to your 
liking and do not hesitate to start building your own Tools.
</Tip>

When finished configuring Sean, start talking to him by clicking on the "Talk to Sales Rep Sean" button.

## Working with the Agent

We can talk with Agents on the conversation view page. There is a list of all conversation on the left. Where we 
can start a new chat using the `+ new chat` button. 
And, the current conversation can be seen and followed on the right.

</Frame>

Clicking on the `N tools` button in the chat window, we can see the list of Skills/Tools with which the agent is equipped. 

<Tip>
**Provide input files to an Agent** 

Click on the paperclip icon and follow the upload wizard. This works by uploading your file to Relevance in a temporary
location and sending the temporary file URL to the Agent in the conversation. 
The Agent knows how to pass the URL to Tools for analyzing the data.
</Tip>

If a skill required permission to run, you will see a question appear in the conversation asking you whether it can be ran or not.

And that's it, with your conversation you can quickly achieve tasks that previously would have taken hours. 
If you have any questions reach out to our team on in-app live chat or join our Discord community.
