Agents are powerful assistants that can be equipped with a variety of Tools. [Tools](/get-started/key-concepts/tools) are designed to target different goals and address different challenges.
This is how with AI workforce, we can expand beyond what is traditionally possible.

<Tip>
**AI Agents are the building blocks of your future AI workforce. The AI workforce that you will build and deploy 
within Relevance.**
</Tip>

Experiment and feedback have proven that best Agents are created by domain experts. Domain experts have the
knowledge to design Tools that are best tailored to companies' specific needs. Consequently, Agents
equipped with custom Tools are more successful in addressing company-specific challenges.

## Creating an Agent
Creating an Agent is a simple process, taking only a few minutes.

On the [Agent](/get-started/key-concepts/agent) page, click on the "+ Create agent" button on the top right.
This will prompt you to a page with two options:
* Build your Agent from scratch
* Use a template (i.e. most settings options are prefilled)

</Frame>

For this guide, we select "Market Research Marco".

## Instruct your Agent

Every Agent has a resume that describes their skills and experience. For best results, it is very important to
think through what we want from an Agent and to include precise instructions while in the configuration phase.

<Tip>
* The more precise you are in the Agents configuration step, the closer the Agents' behavior will be to the desired outcome
* Try your Agent, and come back to the configuration step to improve your setting towards your goal
</Tip>

Marco is a market research coding expert. So, the system prompt describes the company he is working for and what he does. His skill is in coding, sentiment analysis and handling the full analysis workflow. That is helpful :)  

However, to take Marco to the next level, we need to give him some Tools to be able to achieve his goals - just like us,
Marco would not be able to conduct market research without access to data sources and analysis tools.  
Let's make sure he has the right Tools for the job.

## Equip with Tools

<Tip>
 Experiment and feedback have proven that best Agents are created by domain
 experts. Domain experts have the knowledge to design Tools that are best
 tailored to companies' specific needs. Consequently, Agents equipped with 
 custom Tool(s) are more successful in addressing company-specific challenges.

Tools are ways for Agents to interact with other systems. They can be used to perform actions, retrieve information and more. 
In Relevance, [Tools that you create](/build-custom-tools/introduction) are the skills with which you equip your Agents.
This is extremely useful for two reasons:

1. Agents are not limited to or restricted by the available functionality on the platform; you can expand on any functionality that you desire. 
2. The best Agents have Tools created for them by domain experts in a specific company and for a specific use case.

For example, Marco is equipped with the following tools:

- **Upload CSV**: Allows uploading a CSV file. Set to auto run, so user approval is not required.
- **Categorize one sample text data**: Categorizes sample text data. Set to auto run.
- **Bulkrun text analysis**: Performs bulk text analysis. Set to auto run.
- **Identify themes in responses**: Identifies themes in responses. Set to auto run.
- **Calculate category statistics**: Calculates statistics for categories. Set t√•o auto run.
- **Export Knowledge**: Requires user approval to run. Not set to auto run.
- **Evaluate my taxonomy**: Set to auto run. Likely evaluates a taxonomy.
- **Summarize categories & Extract quotes**: Automatically summarizes categories and extracts quotes without requiring user approval.

 Start with these and toggle 
the ones you would give permission for auto-run (i.e. if the toggle is off, Marco will ask for permission to run the Tool each time it is needed).

<Tip>
**Take action and [build your own Tools](/build-custom-tools/introduction)**:

Businesses operate in different ways. Similar to hiring a person, you want to onboard your Agents on your specific ways and to your specific Tools.  

So while benefiting from having a community where you can share and use templates from other members, get started with customizing Tools to your 
liking and do not hesitate to start building your own Tools.
</Tip>

When finished configuring Marco, start talking to him by clicking on the "Talk to Market Research Marco" button.

## Working with the Agent

### Conversation
We can talk with Agents on the conversation view page.
The current conversation can be seen and followed on the right side of tha page.

There is a list of all conversation on the left. 
Click on `+ new chat` button to start a new chat.

<Frame>

</Frame>

### Check Tools

Clicking on the `<N> tools` button in the chat window, we can see the list of Tools with which the agent is equipped.
<Tip>
Use `Edit` at the bottom of the shown list as a shortcut to the configuration step for Tools.
</Tip>

### Provide an input file
Click on the paperclip icon and follow the upload wizard. This works by uploading your file to Relevance in a temporary
location and sending the temporary file URL to the Agent in the conversation.
The Agent knows how to pass the URL to Tools for analyzing the data.

<Tip>
When an input file is required, simply upload a file to the chat window using the paperclip icon. The Agent knows how 
to pass the URL to Tools for analyzing the data.
</Tip>

### Tools execution
When permission for auto-run is granted, a notification indicating what Tool is being used/executed is shown.
When a Tool requires permission to run, a question appears in the conversation asking you whether it can be 
executed or not.
