AI Agents are the building blocks of your future AI workforce that you will build and deploy within Relevance. There are powerful assistants that can be equipped with Skills to expanded their capabilities beyond what's traditionally possible. From our customers, we've seen that the best Agents are created by domain experts equipping them with custom Tools that are tailored to their specific needs. 

Creating an agent is a simple process that can be done in a few minutes. We'll guide you through the process of creating your own in this guide.

## Creating an Agent

Select "Agents" from the sidebar and click on "+ Create Agent". You will then be able to select to start from scratch or from a template.

For this guide, we will use a template so that our next steps are pre-filled. Select "Sales Rep Sean".

## Instruct your agent

Every agent has a resume that describes their skills and experience. It's important to spend time to configure this so that the agent behaves in a way you expect them to.

Each agent has the following details:
- Name
- Emoji
- System prompt
- Suggested replies
- Welcome message

Sean is a sales rep so the system prompt describes the company he is working for and what he does. In this case, his job is to research companies and write personalised outreach emails for them. That's helpful :)

However, to take Sean to the next level we need to give him some skills to be able to achieve this - just like a human wouldn't be able to research a company without a device, the internet and google neither can Sean. Let's make sure he has the right skills for the job.

## Equip skills

Skills are ways for Agents to interact with other systems. They can be used to perform actions, retrieve information and more. In Relevance, the Tools that you create can be equipped as Skills for Agents. This is extremely useful for two reasons:

1. Agents are not limited by the functionality on the platform. It allows you and your team to expand on any functionality that you desire.
2. The best Agents have skills created for them by domain experts for a specific company. Businesses operate in different ways and just like hiring a person, you want to onboard them on your specific ways.

However, the benefit of having a community is that you can share and use templates from other members that you then customise to your liking to fast track. For example, with Sean we have Skills for enriching leads with LinkedIn, google search and web browsing to begin. You can start with these and toggle which ones you'd like to run without asking - if you don't toggle this, Sean will ask to run the skill each time it's needed.

Once you're done, you can start talking to Sean by clicking on the "Talk to Sales Rep Sean" button.

## Working with the Agent

You can talk with your Agent from the conversation view, which has a conversation list on the left sidebar and the current conversation on the right.

You can see the active Tools in the conversation to remind yourself what skills the agent has. You can also attach files to the conversation by clicking on the paperclip icon. This works by uploading the file to Relevance in a temporary location and sending the URL to the file in the conversation to the agent. It can then use Tools that handle file URLs and pass it through. The agent itself cannot process files.

If a skill required permission to run, you will see a question appear in the conversation asking you whether it can be ran or not.

And that's it, with your conversation you can quickly achieve tasks that previously would've taken hours. If you have any questions reach out to our team on in-app live chat or join our Discord community.
