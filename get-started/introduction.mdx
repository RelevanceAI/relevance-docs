## Create an Agent

Creating agents involves giving the agent information about who they are, what they are capable of and what is expected of them. You can create a brand new agent, or use one of our existing [agent templates](/agents/agent-templates).

1. Login to your [Relevance AI](https://relevanceai.com/) account ([app.relevanceai.com](https://relevanceai.com/)).
2. Go to the [Agents](/agents) page (in the sidebar).
3. Click "**+ New**" in the top right-hand corner of the page.
4. Click "**+ Create Agent**" under "Blank agent" to create a new agent from scratch.
5. Give your agent a name, description and optional profile image.

## Equip your agent with tools

One of our key philosophies is that subject matter or domain experts need to be the ones to distill their skills into agents. The way we do this is through our low-code tools, which you can provide with the same knowledge, tools and inputs as your experts.

1. Click "Use Agent" underneath the agent you want to equip with tools on the [Agents](/agents) page.
2. Click the configure agent settings "cog icon" in the top right of your screen.
3. Click "+ Add tools" under the "give your agent powers" section.
4. Search for the tool you want by browsing or keyword.
5. Click the "+ Add" below the tool.

In less than 5 minutes, you can create an agent that produces [SEO-Optimised FAQs](https://relevanceai.com/blog/seo-optimised-faq-writer-agent) just by equipping them with two of our most popular no-code tools: [Google Search](https://relevanceai.com/templates/google-search) and [Website Scraping](https://relevanceai.com/templates/website-scraping-5e6ae).

## Run your agent on autopilot

<CardGroup cols={2}>

    title="Approval Mode"
    icon="person-circle-check"
  >
    Approval mode is where you can look over the agents shoulder before it does critical actions. You can specify which critical actions always has to be approved, or what conditions it needs to meet or information it needs to ask for before it has permission to perform that action.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Autopilot Mode"
    icon="rocket"
  >
    Once you trust that the agent is doing its job exceptionally well, you can put it on autopilot and optionally ask it to escalate to a human when needed. This is what we mean when we say you can grow your business without your headcount.

## Scale your AI Workforce

You can create agents so that they mimic and amplify what already works in your team right now. You can mimic the language they use, their workflow behaviours, the way they use tools, their response style and domain expertise. Then, you can inifitely scale hem.

You can scale agents and multi-agent teams up and down to meet demand. Many of our customers experience seasonal fluctuations in demand, with some time periods or regions requiring more support than others.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How customisable are AI agents?">
    There isn't a single thing in our agents that you cannot change. You can setup agents so that they follow your standard operating procedures.
    
    We're not just a piece of software that is made up of prompts and code that only our team at Relevance AI can edit. You can personally edit and touch these things. During our implementation process, if you have anything that you really like that already work well for you, we can connect those things to agents as tools.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When should you use an agent?">
    AI Agents are especially well-suited for repetitive tasks that your human workforce do not want to do. For example, many Sales teams spend a huge amount of time qualifying leads when they could instead focus on more interesting work further down the funnel, like closing deals.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When should you NOT use an agent?">
    One-off tasks: Building a highly-skilled agent takes a lot of work. If you can’t be sure that the agent you want to build will become a valued part of your team on an ongoing basis, it’s better to direct your energy and resources elsewhere.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who should build agents?">
    Domain experts: We believe that the best person for building out agent team members, are the human team members who are currently doing the work you want to delegate to your agent. Remember that the aim isn’t to replace your human team, but to delegate the repetitive, time-consuming tasks that prevent them from focusing on the work they are most fulfilled by.

    For example, an expert sales rep would be the best person to build an agent to qualify leads for them using the tools that their company use on a daily basis. Once the agent is working to their expert standards, they can then focus on stages later on in the funnel, like closing deals (being much more responsive to customer needs).
