Relevance AI is the home of the AI Workforce. With our platform, you can build highly-skilled agents and multi-agent systems that follow your unique company processes, and use your tech stack much like a human employee would. You can delegate whole or parts of a role to an autonomous AI agent, and infinitely scale their impact.


## 1. Create an Agent

To create an agent.


## 2. Equip your agent with tools

One of our key philosophies is that subject matter or domain experts need to be the ones to distill their skills into agents. 

The way we do this is through our low-code tools, which you can provide with the same knowledge, tools and inputs as your experts.

Once this process is complete, you'll have an agent who has the same skillset as someone on your team does, who can complete their work at scale.

## 3. Approval-Mode

## 4. Run your agent on autopilot

You can delegate roles or parts of a role to an autonomous agent which can complete that work entirely without human input. This is what we mean when we say you can grow your business without your headcount.

## 5. Scale your agent teams

You can scale agents and multi-agent teams up and down to meet demand. Many of our customers experience seasonal fluctuations in demand, with some time periods or regions requiring more support than others (E.g. Education, hospitality and finance industries).

## Key concepts

- [Agent](/get-started/key-concepts/agent): your own AI assistant that can understand what you say, learn from information, and use Tools to automatically complete tasks and answer questions for you.
- [Tools](/get-started/key-concepts/tools): a collection of AI-powered capabilities that enable your Agent to analyze data, retrieve information, and perform specific actions.
- [Data](/get-started/key-concepts/data): sources of truth provided by you in variety of acceptable formats such as PDF, CSV, Audio.
- [Templates](/get-started/key-concepts/templates): variety of pre-built Agents and Tools maintained by Relevance.
- [API keys](/get-started/key-concepts/api-keys): enter your own API key(s) for the many supported vendors.

## Key features

- ### Take full control of your LLM

  Go beyond the basic with functionality like knowledge and our powerful `validators` feature that allows you to define schemas that you want from your LLMs. If the LLM doesn't respond with valid data, we will self heal. This means you can build reliable features with LLMs.

- ### Share Agents and Tools with a URL

  Turning a sequence of prompts into a shareable resource that you can give to the team has never been easier.

- ### No code required

  Our low-code environment lets you build automations with LLMs like an AI Engineer.

- ### Multi-provider support

  Relevance AI supports multiple LLM providers, allowing you to quickly switch between any. Integrate once, use anywhere.

- ### Built-in vector store + integrations

  Relevance AI comes with a built-in [vector store](https://vectordatabase.com) that allows you to store and retrieve vectors for any text. Or, use our integrations to BYO database.

- ### Type safe and flexible SDK

  Our SDK makes it easy to build real applications with LLM powered features. It's provides type hinting for your chains and let's you design every step. We validate types both on compile time _and_ run time in our API.

- ### Magic deployment to API

  Relevance AI is a fully-managed service that allows you to deploy LLM features in minutes. Don't worry about infrastructure, scaling, or maintenance. Simply `relevance deploy` and your chains are live.

## Common use-cases

Advanced use-cases leveraging LLMs can be built by using chains. These are some of the common ones we see companies get started with. However, what they create after that is as varied and impressive as the product teams building them.

- Retrieval + Question and Answering
- Natural language to nQL (SQL, JSON, regex etc)
- Documentation extraction (PDF to CSV)
- Recursive chains (Agents)

Here's an example of a business analyst agent built with Relevance AI's SDK.
