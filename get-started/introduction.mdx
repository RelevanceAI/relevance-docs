Relevance AI is a low/no-code platform where you can build AI agents and multi-agent teams that autonomously complete tasks, much like human employees. 

Agents are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and equipped with tools. They can reason, make decisions, and follow instructions to get work done.


## Use an Agent template

Get started using one of our pre-built agent templates. You can customise every single setting and behaviour so that they work for your specific operating procedures.

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    position: 'relative',
    paddingTop: '56.25%',
  }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cm7b5ffir1d9811onqr56ysos"
    frameBorder="0"
    title="Build an AI agent from scratch in Relevance AI"
    allow="clipboard-write"
    webkitallowfullscreen="true"
    mozallowfullscreen="true"
    allowfullscreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%',
      border: '3px solid #5E43CE',
      borderRadius: '10px',
    }}/>
</div>

## Scale your AI Workforce

You can build agents to mirror and enhance the strengths of your team, replicating their workflows, tool usage, response style, and domain expertise. 

With multi-agent teams, you have the flexibility to scale up or down based on demand. Many of our customers face seasonal fluctuations, where certain periods or regions require more support than others. Agents help you adapt seamlessly, ensuring efficiency without compromising quality.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How customisable are AI agents?">
    Relevance AI agents are fully customisable. You can configure them to align perfectly with your standard operating procedures.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When should you use an agent v a tool?">
    AI tools and AI agents serve different purposes, and choosing the right one depends on your task. AI tools are best for structured, predictable workflows where every step is clearly defined. They follow exact processes, ensuring precision, consistency, and full control over individual steps. Use them for tasks like automated report generation or processing standardized forms. AI agents excel in dynamic, unpredictable scenarios. They can interpret nuanced information, adjust their strategy on the fly, and engage in human-like conversations. Choose agents when flexibility and real-time decision-making are needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who should build agents?">
    The best people to build AI agent team members are the domain experts already performing the tasks you want to delegate. The goal is to free them from repetitive, time-consuming work so they can focus on what they do best. For example, a seasoned sales rep is the ideal person to design an agent for lead qualification — leveraging the same tools and processes they use daily. Once the agent meets their expert standards, they can shift their focus to higher-value tasks, like closing deals and providing more responsive customer engagement.
