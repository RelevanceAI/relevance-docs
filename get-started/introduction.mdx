Relevance AI is a no-code platform where you can build AI agents and multi-agent teams that autonomously complete tasks, much like human employees. 

Agents are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and equipped with tools. They can reason, make decisions, and follow instructions to get work done.

## Create an account and add members

Once you've [signed-up](http://app.relevanceai.com/) and created a Relevance account, you can add other members to your organisation. 

1. Go to Relevance AI and click "[Sign Up](http://app.relevanceai.com/)".
2. Enter your email and password to create an account, or sign up with your Google account.
3. Follow the sign-up wizard, which includes choosing the [region you want to store you data](https://relevanceai.com/docs/security#regions) in.
4. Click on "**Settings**" in the hamburger menu.
5. In "**Projects**", select the default project, or create a new one for your team.
6. Click on "**+ Invite user**" and enter the email of the member you want to add to your organisation.
7. Send invite!

Here's a quick demo of how you create an account and invite team members:

      border: '3px solid #5E43CE',
      borderRadius: '10px',
    }}/>
</div>

### User roles

Members in your organisation can be assigned the following roles: Admin, Editor and Viewer. These roles determine what they can do inside of the platform, and what they can do when using the API.

## Create an agent

Creating agents involves giving the agent information about who they are, what they are capable of and what is expected of them. You can create a brand new agent, or use one of our existing agent templates.

1. Login to your [Relevance AI](https://relevanceai.com/) account ([app.relevanceai.com](https://relevanceai.com/)).
2. Go to the [Agents](/agents) page (in the sidebar).
3. Click "**Build from scratch**" in the top right-hand corner of the page.
4. Give your agent a name, description and profile image.
5. Click “**Confirm**” to save your agent.

## Scale your AI Workforce

You can build agents to mirror and enhance the strengths of your team, replicating their workflows, tool usage, response style, and domain expertise. 

With multi-agent teams, you have the flexibility to scale up or down based on demand. Many of our customers face seasonal fluctuations, where certain periods or regions require more support than others. Agents help you adapt seamlessly, ensuring efficiency without compromising quality.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How customisable are AI agents?">
    Relevance AI agents are fully customisable. You can configure them to align perfectly with your standard operating procedures.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When should you use an agent v a tool?">
    AI tools and AI agents serve different purposes, and choosing the right one depends on your task. AI tools are best for structured, predictable workflows where every step is clearly defined. They follow exact processes, ensuring precision, consistency, and full control over individual steps. Use them for tasks like automated report generation or processing standardized forms. AI agents excel in dynamic, unpredictable scenarios. They can interpret nuanced information, adjust their strategy on the fly, and engage in human-like conversations. Choose agents when flexibility and real-time decision-making are needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who should build agents?">
    The best people to build AI agent team members are the domain experts already performing the tasks you want to delegate. The goal is to free them from repetitive, time-consuming work so they can focus on what they do best. For example, a seasoned sales rep is the ideal person to design an agent for lead qualification — leveraging the same tools and processes they use daily. Once the agent meets their expert standards, they can shift their focus to higher-value tasks, like closing deals and providing more responsive customer engagement.
