Relevance AI is a low/no-code platform where you can build AI agents and multi-agent teams that autonomously complete tasks, much like human employees.

Whether you're looking to automate customer support, scale your sales operations, or streamline internal workflows, Relevance AI provides the tools and infrastructure to build, deploy, and manage your AI workforce.

## Why Relevance AI?

Traditional automation tools require rigid workflows and constant maintenance. AI agents are different—they think, adapt, and learn from experience. With Relevance AI, you can:

- **Deploy agents in minutes** using our no-code builder or pre-built templates
- **Scale on demand** without hiring or training new team members
- **Integrate seamlessly** with your existing tools and workflows
- **Maintain control** with human oversight and approval workflows
- **Customize everything** from agent behavior to escalation protocols

## Getting Started

Watch this quick demo to see how easy it is to build your first AI agent:

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/PLACEHOLDER_SUPADEMO_ID" frameBorder="0" title="Build an AI agent from scratch in Relevance AI" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

## How It Works

Building your AI workforce is straightforward:

1. **Define the role** - Describe what you want your agent to do in plain English
2. **Connect your tools** - Give agents access to the systems they need (CRM, email, databases, etc.)
3. **Add knowledge** - Upload documents, connect data sources, or integrate with your knowledge base
4. **Set guardrails** - Configure approval workflows, escalation paths, and human oversight
5. **Deploy and monitor** - Launch your agent and track performance in real-time
