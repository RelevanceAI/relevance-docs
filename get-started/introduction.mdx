Relevance AI is a low/no-code platform where you can build AI agents and multi-agent teams that autonomously complete tasks, much like human employees.

Whether you're looking to automate customer support, scale your sales operations, or streamline internal workflows, Relevance AI provides the tools and infrastructure to build, deploy, and manage your AI workforce.

## Why Relevance AI?

Traditional automation tools require rigid workflows and constant maintenance. AI agents are different—they think, adapt, and learn from experience. With Relevance AI, you can:

- **Deploy agents in minutes** using our no-code builder or pre-built templates
- **Scale on demand** without hiring or training new team members
- **Integrate seamlessly** with your existing tools and workflows
- **Maintain control** with human oversight and approval workflows
- **Customize everything** from agent behavior to escalation protocols

## How It Works

Relevance AI gives you everything you need to build, connect, and scale an AI workforce:

1. **Build agents** — create AI agents that autonomously complete tasks. Use Invent to generate one from a description, clone a pre-built agent from the Marketplace, or build from scratch.
2. **Give them tools** — equip agents with actions like sending emails, updating your CRM, searching the web, or calling any API — all built in a no-code tool builder.
3. **Add knowledge** — connect your data so agents respond with accuracy. Upload files, sync from Google Drive, SharePoint, Notion, or pull from websites.
4. **Connect them into workforces** — link multiple agents together on a visual canvas to handle complex, multi-step workflows. Each agent focuses on what it's best at, and the workforce handles the handoffs.
5. **Set guardrails and deploy** — configure escalations, approval workflows, and triggers, then put your workforce to work.
