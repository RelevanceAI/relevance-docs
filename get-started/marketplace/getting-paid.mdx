If you have set up your Stripe account, you will be able to list Agents for a price of your choosing.

## How big a cut does Relevance AI take?

Relevance currently does not take any cut from the payments you receive for Marketplace listings. The small Stripe transaction fee will however come out of your fee.

<Note>
This means you keep 100% of your listing price (minus Stripe's standard processing fees, which are typically around 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction).
</Note>

## How much should I charge?

The price you set for an agent is up to you, though we have an absolute limit of no more than $1000 USD. We recommend setting a lower price to ensure uptake and demand, to grow your clone count and build trust before increasing prices.

### Pricing strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with free or low-cost listings" icon="gift">
    When you first get started, consider listing your Agents for free or at a lower price to increase your clone count. After a while, you can then start to increase your prices as you build trust within the Relevance AI community.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider the value provided" icon="scale-balanced">
    Price your Agent based on the value it provides:
    - **Simple automation** ($5-$25): Basic task automation or simple workflows
    - **Moderate complexity** ($25-$100): Multi-step processes with integrations
    - **Advanced solutions** ($100-$500): Complex workflows with multiple tools and sophisticated logic
    - **Enterprise-grade** ($500-$1000): Highly specialized, industry-specific solutions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Research similar listings" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Browse the Marketplace to see how similar Agents are priced. This will help you position your listing competitively.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Offer tiered pricing" icon="layer-group">

    - Basic version (free or low-cost)
    - Pro version with additional features
    - Enterprise version with premium capabilities
  </Accordion>

## If someone buys my Agent, do they still have to pay for a Relevance AI subscription?

In most cases — yes. While our free tier gives customers access to 100 credits per day, if they need more than this to run your Agent and any others they have, they'll need to upgrade.

Purchasing listings from the Marketplace would then be an additional cost.

## Can I earn money from referring customers to the platform?

Sure! You can join our affiliate program at [https://relevance-ai.getrewardful.com/signup](https://relevance-ai.getrewardful.com/signup)

You can use this link to refer customers to Relevance AI, who can then purchase your Agents from the Marketplace.

## How can I get more people to buy my Agents and Tools?

### Set your Agents to a lower price / free to start

When you first get started, it's a good idea to list your Agents for a lower price to increase your clone count. After a while, you can then start to increase your prices as you build trust within the Relevance AI community.

## Payment and refund policies

### When do I receive payments?

Payments are processed through Stripe according to their standard payout schedule. Typically, funds are transferred to your bank account within 2-7 business days after a purchase, depending on your country and bank.

### How do refunds work?

Relevance has a 1 week, no questions asked, refund policy for purchased Marketplace listings. When a user refunds a listing, they will lose access to that listing and will not be able to use it. This money will be taken out of your Stripe account.

After 1 week, our policy is not to offer refunds. This means customers will need to assess within a week whether or not they wish to continue using your listing.

<Tip>
To minimize refunds, make sure your Agent descriptions are accurate and comprehensive, and provide clear usage instructions. The better customers understand what they're getting, the less likely they are to request refunds.
</Tip>

You can track your earnings and sales through:

1. **Stripe Dashboard**: View detailed transaction history, payouts, and analytics
