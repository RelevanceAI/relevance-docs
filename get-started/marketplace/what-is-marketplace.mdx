The Relevance Marketplace is a community-led initiative to allow approved Relevance Builders to share Tools, Agents, and Workforces with Relevance users. Builders will be able to list entities for free, or for a price.

Relevance AI customers will then be able to download / purchase Agents from you through our Marketplace, and use them on Relevance AI.

## What is a Relevance Builder, and how do I become one?

Relevance Builders are approved builders who are able to submit listings to the Relevance Marketplace.

**Builder access is now open to all Relevance users!** You can start submitting Agents and Tools to the Marketplace right away. Simply navigate to the Relevance Builders section in your project to set up your profile and begin submitting listings.

<Note>
**Note for Enterprise users:** If you're part of an Enterprise organization with Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC), your ability to become a Relevance Builder and submit to the Marketplace depends on your assigned permissions. Users with Viewer or Chat-only roles at the project level, or those with limited asset-level permissions, may not be able to create or submit Marketplace listings. Contact your organization administrator if you need elevated permissions.
</Note>

Once you set up your Relevance Builder profile, you will also be given access to our Community discussion space for Relevance Builders, and be tagged as a Relevance Builder in the Community when posting Agents, answering questions, etc.
