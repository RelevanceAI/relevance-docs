Relevance provides a variety of resources from space to temporarily or permanently store data to in-cloud analysis resources.

Below is a brief overview of maximum system resource allocations:

## Maximum allowed file size

|                     Resource                |  Quota |
|---------------------------------------------|--------|
| Upload space                                | 100 MB |
| Upload space for CSV file - number of rows  | 50 K   |
| Upload space for raw text size as knowledge | 10 MB  |

## Maximum allowed run time

|            Resource            |    Quota   |
|--------------------------------|------------|
| Tools (15 minutes)             | 15 minutes |
| Tools (24 hour)                | 24 hours   |
| Tools (deprecated)             | 15 minutes |
| Agents after each user action  | 15 minutes |
| Bulk run                       |  24 hours  |

## Concurrent Tasks
In the context of Relevance AI, task concurrency refers to the number of tasks that can be executed simultaneously by the system. This is a critical aspect of performance, especially when dealing with webhooks, multi-agent systems, and high-volume scenarios.

Understanding concurrent agent tasks is essential for optimizing performance. When multiple users interact with your application at the same time, the ability to handle these requests efficiently can significantly impact user experience. 

Concurrency limits are determined by your subscription tier. Each tier has different limits on the number of concurrent agent tasks that can be processed simultaneously.

<Note>
If you're experiencing issues related to task concurrency, consider upgrading your subscription tier. If you are considering an Enterprise plan, please [book a demo](https://relevanceai.com/book-a-demo) with our sales team to discuss your unique needs.
</Note>

### How It Works
- The number of concurrent tasks you are allowed is determined by your subscription tier, **not** the type of trigger (webhook, API, or scheduled).
- When the concurrency limit is reached, additional tasks will be queued until resources become available.

When you hit your concurrency limits, users may experience delays in task execution. For example, if you have a chatbot with multiple simultaneous users and your tier's concurrency limit is reached, additional requests will be queued, leading to slower response times.
