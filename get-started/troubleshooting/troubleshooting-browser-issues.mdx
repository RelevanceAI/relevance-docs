The browser is what you use to access Relevance AI on your desktop computer. This includes Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and other modern browsers. Because all browsers are different, sometimes you might experience issues with Relevance AI because of the browser you are using. These issues can range from login problems (such as blank pages or login loops) to unexpected behavior in Relevance AI once you log in, including slow loading times, broken features, or integration failures. This article will help you troubleshoot those issues and get back to using Relevance AI smoothly.

</Warning>

## Basic troubleshooting steps

If you're experiencing issues with Relevance AI, try the following steps in order:

### 1. Update your browser

Make sure you're using the latest version of your browser. Outdated browsers may not support all the features required by Relevance AI.

### 2. Disable browser extensions

Browser extensions can sometimes interfere with Relevance AI's functionality. Try disabling all extensions temporarily:

1. Open your browser in incognito/private mode
2. Navigate to [app.relevanceai.com](https://app.relevanceai.com)
3. Test if the issue persists

If the issue is resolved in incognito mode, one of your extensions is likely causing the problem.

### 3. Clear browser cache

Clearing your browser's cache can resolve many common issues:

- **Chrome**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
- **Firefox**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
- **Safari**: Go to Safari menu > Clear History and Website Data
- **Edge**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)

### 4. Try a different browser

Test Relevance AI in a different browser to see if the issue is browser-specific.

### 5. Check your network connection

Try connecting to a different network to rule out network-related issues.

### 6. Check antivirus software

Make sure your antivirus software isn't blocking the following Relevance AI domains:

- `app.relevanceai.com`
- `chat.relevanceai.com` 
- `marketplace.relevanceai.com`
- `api-REGIONID.stack.tryrelevanceai.com` (replace REGIONID with your [region ID](/get-started/project-management/ids))

## Troubleshooting specific issues

### Login problems

If you're having trouble logging in:

1. **Blank login page**: Clear your browser cache and try incognito mode
2. **Login loop**: Disable browser extensions and try incognito mode
3. **Invalid credentials**: Double-check your email and password, or [reset your password](/get-started/account-management/change-password) if needed
4. **SSO login issues**: If you're using Single Sign-On (SSO), contact your Enterprise admin for assistance with authentication problems

### Performance issues

If Relevance AI is running slowly:

1. **Check your internet connection**: Ensure you have a stable, fast connection
2. **Close unnecessary tabs**: Free up browser memory
3. **Disable resource-heavy extensions**: Ad blockers and privacy tools can slow down the platform
4. **Clear browser cache**: Accumulated cache can impact performance

### Integration connection problems

If integrations aren't working:

1. **Check pop-up blockers**: Some integrations require pop-ups to be allowed
2. **Verify domain permissions**: Ensure the integration domains are allowed
3. **Check antivirus settings**: Make sure your antivirus isn't blocking integration domains

## Browser console errors

If you're still experiencing issues, check your browser's console for error messages:

### Opening the console

- **Chrome**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+J` (Windows) or `Cmd+Opt+J` (Mac)
- **Firefox**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+K` (Windows) or `Cmd+Opt+K` (Mac)
- **Safari**: Enable Developer menu in Preferences > Advanced, then press `Cmd+Opt+C`
- **Edge**: Press `F12` and go to the 'Console' tab

### Common error messages

Look for these common error messages in the console:

- **CORS errors**: Usually related to domain restrictions
- **Network errors**: Check your internet connection
- **JavaScript errors**: May indicate browser compatibility issues
- **Authentication errors**: Check your login credentials

  If you find error messages in the console, take a screenshot or copy the error text and include it when contacting support.
