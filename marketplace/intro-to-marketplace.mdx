The Relevance AI Marketplace is a one-stop shop for finding Agents and Tools that match your needs. It offers a curated selection of ready-to-use AI agents designed to automate tasks, streamline workflows, and enhance productivity across a wide range of use cases. Whether you're looking to solve a specific problem or explore what's possible with AI, the Marketplace makes it easy to get started.

## Who can add Agents / Tools to the Marketplace?

Agents and Tools in the Marketplace have been created by Relevance AI employees (Rellies) and Relevance Builders from our community.

Anyone can become a Relevance Builder and start submitting their own Agents and Tools to the Marketplace. Learn more in our [Relevance Builders guide](/marketplace/relevance-builders/become-a-relevance-builder).

<Note>
**Note for Enterprise users:** If you're part of an Enterprise organization with Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC), your ability to become a Relevance Builder and submit to the Marketplace depends on your assigned permissions. Users with Viewer or Chat-only roles at the project level, or those with limited asset-level permissions, may not be able to create or submit Marketplace listings. Contact your organization administrator if you need elevated permissions.
</Note>

## Do I have to pay for Agents / Tools?

Some Agents and Tools in the Marketplace require payment. Pricing is determined by the creator of each listing. If you purchase a paid Agent or Tool and it doesn't perform as expected, you can request a refund within seven days of your purchase. Refunds are not available after this seven-day window.

We recommend first reaching out to our support team to get help before pursuing a refund, to make sure we can help you use your purchased listing first.

To view and manage your Marketplace purchases:

<Note>
**Important details about Marketplace purchases:**

- **Purchases are project-specific** – When you purchase a listing in one project, it won't appear in the My Purchases page of another project
- **Cross-project cloning requires permission** – You can only clone a purchased listing into a different project if the Relevance Builder who created it has enabled this feature
- **Licensing per project** – Most Builders restrict cross-project cloning for paid listings to ensure proper licensing and usage rights for each project
- **Free listings aren't tracked** – The My Purchases page only displays paid listings. Free listings can be cloned again at any time directly from the Marketplace without appearing in your purchase history
