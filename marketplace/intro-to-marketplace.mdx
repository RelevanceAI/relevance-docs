The Relevance AI Marketplace is a one-stop shop for finding Agents and Tools that match your needs. It offers a curated selection of ready-to-use AI agents designed to automate tasks, streamline workflows, and enhance productivity across a wide range of use cases. Whether you're looking to solve a specific problem or explore what's possible with AI, the Marketplace makes it easy to get started.

## Who can add Agents / Tools to the Marketplace?

Agents and Tools in the Marketplace have been created by Relevance AI employees (Rellies) and Relevance Builders from our community.

Anyone can become a Relevance Builder and start submitting their own Agents and Tools to the Marketplace. Learn more in our [Relevance Builders guide](/marketplace/relevance-builders/become-a-relevance-builder).

<Note>
**Note for Enterprise users:** If you're part of an Enterprise organization with Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC), your ability to become a Relevance Builder and submit to the Marketplace depends on your assigned permissions. Users with Viewer or Chat-only roles at the project level, or those with limited asset-level permissions, may not be able to create or submit Marketplace listings. Contact your organization administrator if you need elevated permissions.
</Note>

## Do I have to pay for Agents / Tools?

Some Agents and Tools in the Marketplace require payment. Pricing is determined by the creator of each listing. If you purchase a paid Agent or Tool and it doesn't perform as expected, you can request a refund within seven days of your purchase. Refunds are not available after this seven-day window.

We recommend first reaching out to our support team to get help before pursuing a refund, to make sure we can help you use your purchased listing first. 

## I need help using an Agent / Tool I've cloned from the Marketplace

Please [reach out to our support team](/get-started/support) for assistance. If you purchased an Agent / Tool, we can help contact them on your behalf if you need their help.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Are purchases tied to a specific project?">
        Yes. When you purchase a listing, it's tied to the specific project where you made the purchase. If you purchase a listing on one project, you won't see it in My Purchases on another project.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I purchased a listing on the Marketplace, can I clone it to other projects?">
        Not always. Relevance Builders can choose to make their listings clonable or not. If they have made their listing clonable, you can clone it to any of your projects. If they have not made their listing clonable, you can only use it in the project you purchased it in. Most Builders restrict cross-project cloning for paid listings to ensure proper licensing per project.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Can I modify Agents or Tools I've purchased from the Marketplace?">
        Yes, you have full access to modify any Agent or Tool you've purchased. You can customize prompts, add or remove tools, adjust settings, and make any other changes to fit your specific needs.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="How do I know if a listing is free or paid before purchasing?">
        All pricing information is clearly displayed on each Marketplace listing. Free listings are marked as "Free" while paid listings show the price. You'll see the cost before confirming your purchase.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Why don't I see free listings in My Purchases?">
        The My Purchases page only displays paid listings you've purchased. Free listings can be cloned again at any time directly from the Marketplace without needing to track them in your purchase history.
