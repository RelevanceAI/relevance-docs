As a Relevance Builder, understanding your support responsibilities and engaging with the community will help you build trust and increase the success of your Marketplace listings.

## Do I need to support my Agents / Tools?

You will not need to support your *free* Agents / Tools. Any free Agents / Tools that you add to the Marketplace will be supported by our Relevance AI support team, but if someone asks about them in the Community, we'd appreciate if you could help out and answer questions.

For paid Agents / Tools, our support team will attempt to troubleshoot with your customers first. However, our support team may reach out to you, or direct your customers to you, if they're unable to help your customers with your Agents.

<Note>
**Best practice**: Even for free listings, being responsive to questions in the Community helps build your reputation and can lead to more downloads and purchases of your other listings.
</Note>

## How do refunds work?

Relevance has a 1 week, no questions asked, refund policy for purchased Marketplace listings. When a user refunds a listing, they will lose access to that listing and will not be able to use it. This money will be taken out of your Stripe account.

After 1 week, our policy is not to offer refunds. This means customers will need to assess within a week whether or not they wish to continue using your listing.

<Tip>
To minimize refunds, provide clear and accurate descriptions of what your Agent does, include comprehensive usage instructions, respond quickly to support questions, and keep your Agents well-maintained and updated.
</Tip>

## Joining the Community

It is expected that Relevance Builders are also passionate members of our Relevance AI Community. Once you set up your Relevance Builder profile, you will be given a badge in the Community that shows your status as a Relevance Builder.

### Share your listings

You are encouraged to post any listings you submit to the Marketplace in our [Agent Templates](https://community.relevanceai.com/c/agent-templates) section. This will bring more attention to your listing, and allow you to chat with customers who download / purchase your listing directly. We also encourage you to share your listings on social media (LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, etc.).

### Answer questions

We would also appreciate you keeping an eye out for questions related to your listings in the [Questions](https://community.relevanceai.com/c/questions) section. We may tag you in questions if we believe they're about your listings if we can't solve these questions ourselves.

### Relevance Builders space

You'll also have access to a dedicated space for Relevance Builders in the Community. Join the Community to access this space where you can discuss with fellow Relevance Builders and the Relevance AI team, share your listings and learnings, and leave feedback for the Relevance AI team.

<Info>
Relevance Builders who spend more time in the Community build more trust with our customer base, and therefore have more success in our Marketplace.

## Measuring your success

Track these metrics to understand how well you're supporting your Agents:

- **Clone count**: How many times your Agents have been downloaded
- **Refund rate**: Percentage of purchases that result in refunds
- **Community engagement**: Questions answered, posts made, discussions participated in
- **Customer feedback**: Reviews, testimonials, and direct feedback
- **Update frequency**: How often you improve and update your listings

<Tip>
Builders with low refund rates, high community engagement, and regular updates tend to have the most successful Marketplace presence.
</Tip>

## Getting help

If you need assistance with supporting your Agents or have questions about your responsibilities as a Builder:

- **Relevance Builders space**: Ask questions in the private Builders community
- **Support team**: Reach out to our support team for guidance
