Your Relevance Builders profile is where you'll manage your Marketplace listings and receive payments. This guide will walk you through setting up your profile and connecting your Stripe account.

## Setting up your profile

Your Relevance Builders profile will be connected to one of your projects — we recommend creating a new project, adding all of your Agents that you want to list to this project, and creating your profile from here.

## Connecting to a Stripe account

If you wish to receive payments for paid listings, you'll need to connect to a Stripe account. If you only wish to add free Agents and Tools to the Marketplace, you do not need to follow this step.
