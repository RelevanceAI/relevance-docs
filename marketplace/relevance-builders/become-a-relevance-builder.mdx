## What is a Relevance Builder?

Relevance Builders are approved builders who are able to submit listings to the Relevance Marketplace. Once you set up your Relevance Builder profile, you will also be given access to our Community discussion space for Relevance Builders, and be tagged as a Relevance Builder in the Community when posting Agents, answering questions, etc.

You can start submitting Agents and Tools to the Marketplace right away. Simply navigate to the Relevance Builders section in your project to set up your profile and begin submitting listings.
