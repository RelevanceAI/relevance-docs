## Adding Agents to Your Workforce

### Prerequisites
Before adding agents to your workforce, ensure you have:
- Created at least two agents in your project
- Access to Workforce

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Access Workforce**
   - Select your workforce or create a new one
   - Navigate to the "Build" section in your workforce

2. **Add Your First Agent**
   - When you first open your workforce, you'll see a manual trigger already in place
   - Connect an agent to this trigger by dragging an agent from the sidebar onto the workspace
   - This initial connection allows you to message that particular agent (similar to the existing agent flow in Agents)

3. **Add Additional Agents**
   - Drag additional agents from the sidebar onto the workspace
   - Position them strategically based on your workflow requirements

4. **Connect Agents Together**
   - Click and drag from one agent to create a connection line to another agent
   - When connecting agents, you'll be prompted to select a connection type:
   - **Agent Decide**: The agent makes its own decision on whether to talk to another agent
   - **Forced Handover**: An agent will always hand over what it was doing to the next agent, regardless of its finished state

5. **Configure Connection Settings**
   - After creating a connection, click on the connecting line to configure edge settings
   - For "Let agent decide" connections:
     - Complete the "When to call this agent" box with natural language instructions

     - Set behavior settings (auto run, approval required, or let agent decide)
     - Configure max auto runs as a guardrail
     - Choose between 'always start a new task' or 'always continue with one task'
   - For "Forced handover" connections:
     - Choose between 'always start a new task' or 'always continue with one task'

6. **Save Your Configuration**
   - Click the "Save" button to preserve your workforce configuration

## Communication Settings

When connecting agents, you can configure how they communicate with each other:

### Let Agent Decide
Use natural language to explain how the agent should behave. The agent will follow your instructions but will escalate if it needs help or clarification.

- **Communication Settings**: Explain in natural language when this agent should be called. For example, if a manager agent is delegating to another agent, explain the logic for when to delegate to that specific agent.
- **Behavior Settings**:
  - **Auto run**: The agent will complete the task without approval
  - **Approval required**: The agent will draft the task but ask for approval before completing
  - **Let agent decide**: The agent will complete the task if confident, otherwise will ask for approval
  - **Max auto runs**: Set a limit on the number of times the agent auto runs

### Forced Handover
This setting forces one agent to pass the task to another agent. The handover must happen regardless of the first agent's state.

## Best Practices for Adding Agents

1. **Define Clear Roles**
   - Give each agent a specific role and responsibility within your workforce
   - Avoid overlapping responsibilities that could cause confusion

2. **Create Logical Workflows**
   - Arrange agents in a way that follows a natural progression of tasks
   - Consider the information flow between agents when designing your workforce

3. **Use Descriptive Connection Instructions**

   - When using "Let agent decide" connections, provide clear, detailed instructions about when to delegate
   - Include specific criteria or conditions that should trigger the handover

4. **Test Incrementally**
   - Add and test agents one at a time to ensure each connection works as expected
   - Use the Task View to monitor how agents interact with each other

5. **Set Appropriate Approval Levels**
   - For critical tasks, use "Approval required" to maintain human oversight
   - For routine tasks, consider "Auto run" to maximize efficiency

## Monitoring Your Multi-Agent Workforce

After adding agents to your workforce:

1. Go to the "Task" view to see your workforce in action
2. Here you can trigger your workforce via manual messages/conversation
3. Monitor when specific agents need approvals
4. Observe how agents communicate and hand off tasks to each other

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Agents aren't communicating as expected  
**Solution**: Check the connection settings between agents and ensure the instructions are clear and specific.

**Issue**: Workflow stops unexpectedly  
**Solution**: Check if an agent is waiting for approval in the Task View.

**Issue**: Agent makes incorrect decisions about when to delegate  
**Solution**: Refine the natural language instructions in the "When to call this agent" field.
