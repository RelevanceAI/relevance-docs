## Overview

Conditions enable you to build dynamic, responsive workflows by creating branching paths based on specific criteria. Rather than having a linear workflow where every step always executes in the same order, conditions let you implement decision points that determine which path your workflow should take.

## When to Use Conditions

Conditions are particularly valuable when you need to:

- Process data differently based on specific values or states
- Create branching workflows with different paths for different scenarios
- Implement quality control checks before proceeding to critical steps
- Filter out certain items from further processing
- Execute tools only on specific days, times, or under certain circumstances

## Adding a Condition to Your Workforce

To add a condition to your workforce:

1. Navigate to the "Build" section of your Workforce
2. Locate the "Conditions" option in the node selection panel
3. Drag a condition node onto your workspace
4. Connect the condition to the appropriate tools or agents

## Configuring Conditions

Setting up conditions in Workforce is simple thanks to natural language configuration. Instead of complex technical settings, you can simply describe your condition in plain English:

1. Click on your condition node to open its settings
2. Enter a natural language description of your condition, such as:
   - "Go down this path if the day is a weekday"
   - "Follow this route if the customer score is above 80"
   - "Use this path if the email contains the word 'urgent'"
