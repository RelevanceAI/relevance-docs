Relevance AI has built-in datasets that are NoSQL-based documents and support storing vector embeddings and vector search.

## What is a dataset?

A dataset is a collection of documents that are stored in a NoSQL database. 
Each document has a unique ID and a set of fields. Each field can be a string, number, date, or a vector. 
A vector is a list of numbers that represent a point in a multi-dimensional space.

<Tip>
Vectors are additional features to a dataset. Such a feature enables better performance in tasks including search, and
answer retrieval. In other words, vectors add extra knowledge to AI.
Therefore, at Relevance, a dataset containing Vectors is referred to as Knowledge enabled.
</Tip>

On the [Data](/get-started/key-concepts/data) page, you can see all your uploaded datasets. If a dataset is vectorized, it appears 
under "Knowledge" and under "Datasets" otherwise.

## How to create a data table
On the [Data](/get-started/key-concepts/data) page, click on `Create table` on the top right and choose the option matching
you data.
* Blank: to create and empty table
* Upload file: to upload a file (CSV, PDF, MP3, ...)
    <Info>
    - PDF files automatically go through a PDF-to-Text steps
    - Audio/Video files automatically go through a transcription step
    </Info>
* Import from a website: to scrape a website and save the data in the table
* Integration: to import data from a third party

### Upload file
Simply select the file(s) or drag and drop them in the box and type a name for your data table.
<Tip>
1. Data table names can only contain small letters, number and `-`. Relevance automatically replaces any other character with a `-`.
2. You can upload multiple files at onces.
</Tip>

![Upload data](/images/data/data-upload1.png)

Click on `Upload data to table` and wait till the upload process finalizes. Note that the larger the files, the longer the upload time.

### Enable knowledge
After the data is saved in a data table, Relevance detects all fields that can be vectorized and be later used as knowledge for an AI agent
or for further analysis.

![Enable knowledge](/images/data/enable-knowledge.png)

You can vectorize all fields (`Select all`) or only select your desired fields and then click on `Continue`.

Note that only knowledge enabled data can be used for further analysis.
