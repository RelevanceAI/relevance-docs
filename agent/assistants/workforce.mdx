# AI Assistant Workforce

An AI Assistant Workforce is when multiple AI Assistants work together to complete complex tasks that span across different platforms and tools. Instead of using a single assistant, you orchestrate several assistants to collaborate on a unified goal.

## How It Works

Each assistant in your workforce specializes in one platform (Notion, Gmail, Google Docs, etc.) and has access to that platform's full API capabilities. When you give a complex task that requires multiple platforms, the assistants automatically:

1. **Break down the task** into platform-specific subtasks
2. **Execute in sequence** - each assistant completes its part
3. **Pass information** between assistants as needed
4. **Deliver the complete result** - all steps handled automatically

<Note>
Workforce capabilities are built on the **MRP (Model Relevance Protocol)** methodology, which allows assistants to dynamically figure out complex tasks using simple, low-level API tools and thinking models like GPT-4.1.
</Note>

## Workforce Example

Here's a real example of multiple assistants working together:

### The Task

```
"Please research dinosaurs, create a presentation about them, 
save the presentation to a folder called 'DinosaurFacts' and 
email the slides to 'colleague@company.com'"
```

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

This single request automatically coordinates **4 different AI Assistants**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Research Agent">
    Searches for relevant information about dinosaurs from knowledge sources or the web
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Google Slides Assistant">
    Creates a presentation with the researched content, formats slides, adds structure
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Google Drive Assistant">
    Creates the "DinosaurFacts" folder and saves the presentation to it
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Gmail Assistant">
    Composes and sends an email with the presentation link to the specified recipient
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Result:** A complete workflow that would take 20-30 minutes manually is handled in minutes through natural language.

## Benefits of AI Assistant Workforces

### Cross-Platform Workflows

Connect tools that don't normally integrate:
- Research in one platform → Document creation in another → Sharing via email
- CRM data extraction → Presentation generation → Team collaboration setup
- Content management → Publishing → Notification distribution

### Complex Multi-Step Tasks

Handle sophisticated workflows that require:
- Sequential operations across platforms
- Data transformation between tools
- Coordination of multiple API calls per assistant
- Context passing between different systems

### Natural Language Orchestration

No need to:
- Build custom integrations
- Write code or scripts
- Manually coordinate between platforms
- Remember specific API endpoints or parameters

Simply describe what you want in plain English, and the workforce figures out how to achieve it.

## Common Workforce Patterns

### Content Creation Pipeline

**Assistants involved:** Google Docs, Google Slides, Gmail, Notion

**Example task:**
```
"Create a weekly report doc with last week's metrics from Notion, 
generate a summary slide deck, and email both to the team"
```

### CRM to Communication

**Assistants involved:** HubSpot/Salesforce, Gmail, Google Docs

**Example task:**
```
"Find all leads created this month, create a prospect list document, 
and send personalized intro emails to each one"
```

### Cross-Platform Data Migration

**Assistants involved:** Multiple platform assistants

**Example task:**
```
"Export all projects from Notion, create corresponding deals in HubSpot, 
and send me a summary of what was migrated"
```

### Workflow Automation

**Assistants involved:** Any combination of assistants

**Example task:**
```
"Every time a deal closes in Salesforce, create a project in Notion 
and send a kickoff email to the team"
```

## How MRP Powers Workforces

AI Assistant Workforces are powered by the **Model Relevance Protocol (MRP)**:

- Each assistant uses **1-3 low-level API tools** (not hundreds of pre-built tools)
- They have **API documentation** to understand their platform
- They use **thinking models** (like GPT-4.1) to reason through tasks dynamically
- They can **self-heal** - learning from mistakes and retrying operations

This architecture means:
- ✅ Assistants can handle tasks they weren't explicitly programmed for
- ✅ New capabilities emerge as APIs are updated (just update documentation)
- ✅ Complex workflows work automatically without custom integration code
- ✅ Token usage is optimized through API result minification

    Follow the [Quick Start Guide](/agent/assistants/assistants-quickstart) to set up API keys or direct integrations for each assistant
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Your Workforce">
    In Relevance AI, create a workforce and add your configured assistants to it
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Give It a Task">
    Describe your complete workflow in natural language - the workforce will coordinate the assistants automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for Workforce Tasks

<Tip>
**Be explicit about the complete workflow** - Mention each platform and what should happen in each step

*Example: "Get my recent contacts from HubSpot, create a summary document in Google Docs, and email it to my team"*
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Specify the order when it matters** - Use sequential language like "first", "then", "finally"

*Example: "First create the Notion database, then add sample projects, finally send me a summary email"*
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Include necessary identifiers** - Provide file names, email addresses, collection names, etc.

*Example: "Save to folder 'Q1 Reports'" or "Email to team@company.com"*
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Test individual steps first** - Before running a complex workflow, test that each assistant can handle its part independently
</Tip>
