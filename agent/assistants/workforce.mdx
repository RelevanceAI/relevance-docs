# AI Assistant Workforce

An AI Assistant Workforce is when multiple AI Assistants work together to complete complex tasks that span across different platforms and tools. Instead of using a single assistant, you orchestrate several assistants to collaborate on a unified goal.

## AI Assistant Workforce vs. Regular Workforce

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AI Assistant Workforce" icon="store">
    Uses pre-built AI Assistants from the Marketplace designed for specific platforms
    
    • Ready-to-use assistants (Notion, Gmail, HubSpot, etc.)
    
    • No setup required beyond connecting integrations
    
    • Optimized for common platform tasks
    
    • Best for cross-platform workflows
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Regular Workforce" icon="hammer">
    Uses custom agents you build yourself for specific business needs
    
    • Tailored to your unique processes
    
    • Can include custom tools and logic
    
    • Requires agent building and configuration
    
    • Best for specialized workflows
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
**Can you mix and match?** 

Yes! You can combine AI Assistants with your custom agents in the same workforce:
- Use both pre-built assistants and custom agents together
- Create hybrid workflows that leverage the best of both
- Example: Use a custom research agent to gather data, then have the Gmail Assistant send results to your team
</Note>

## How It Works

Each assistant in your workforce specializes in one platform (Notion, Gmail, Google Docs, etc.) and has access to that platform's full API capabilities. When you give a complex task that requires multiple platforms, the assistants automatically:

1. **Break down the task** into platform-specific subtasks
2. **Execute in sequence** - each assistant completes its part
3. **Pass information** between assistants as needed
4. **Deliver the complete result** - all steps handled automatically

### The Technology Behind It

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Flexible API Tools" icon="screwdriver-wrench">
    Each assistant uses adaptable tools that work across different tasks and platforms
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Comprehensive Documentation" icon="book">
    Assistants have full API documentation to understand their platform's capabilities
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Advanced AI Models" icon="brain">
    Uses models like GPT-4 to reason through tasks and make intelligent decisions
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Self-Healing" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Learns from mistakes and automatically retries operations for better results
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
**What this means for you:**

- Assistants can handle tasks they weren't explicitly programmed for
- New capabilities emerge as APIs are updated
- Complex workflows work automatically without custom integration code
- Performance is optimized for efficiency
</Note>

## Workforce Example

Here's an example of multiple assistants working together:

### The Task

```
"Please research dinosaurs, create a presentation about them, 
save the presentation to a folder called 'DinosaurFacts' and 
email the slides to 'colleague@company.com'"
```

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

This single request automatically coordinates **4 different AI Assistants**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Research Agent">
    Searches for relevant information about dinosaurs from knowledge sources or the web
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Google Slides Assistant">
    Creates a presentation with the researched content, formats slides, adds structure
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Google Drive Assistant">
    Creates the "DinosaurFacts" folder and saves the presentation to it
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Gmail Assistant">
    Composes and sends an email with the presentation link to the specified recipient
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Result:** Simply describe what you need in plain English, and it all happens automatically.

## Tips for Workforce Tasks

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Explicit About the Workflow" icon="list-check">
    Mention each platform and what should happen in each step to ensure the workforce understands the complete task.
    
    **Example:** *"Get my recent contacts from HubSpot, create a summary document in Google Docs, and email it to my team"*
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Specify the Order" icon="arrow-down-1-9">
    Use sequential language like "first", "then", "finally" when the order of operations matters for your workflow.
    
    **Example:** *"First create the Notion database, then add sample projects, finally send me a summary email"*
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include Identifiers" icon="tag">
    Provide specific file names, email addresses, folder names, or collection names so assistants know exactly where to work.
    
    **Example:** *"Save to folder 'Q1 Reports'" or "Email to team@company.com"*
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Individual Steps" icon="flask">
    Before running a complex multi-assistant workflow, test that each assistant can handle its part independently. This helps identify issues early and ensures smoother execution.
  </Accordion>
