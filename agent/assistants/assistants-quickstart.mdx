## Step 2: Configure Your Assistant

<Warning>
**⚠️ CRITICAL SETUP - Complete this BEFORE first use**

You must add your API credentials before using your assistant, otherwise you'll see authentication errors.
</Warning>

### What is an API Key?

Think of an API key as a **secure password** that lets the AI assistant access your account on your behalf. It's like giving the assistant a special key to your workspace so it can create, update, and manage things for you—without needing your actual login password.

**Why you need it:**
- The assistant needs permission to make changes in your account
- API keys are safer than sharing your password
- You can revoke the key anytime if needed

### Configuration Checklist

After cloning your assistant, you'll need to provide:

- ✅ **API Key** - A special access token from your integration (see instructions below)
- ✅ **Site/Account ID** - Your specific workspace or site identifier
- ✅ **Documentation** - Pre-loaded (leave as-is, don't modify)

### Where to Add These

1. After cloning, a setup popup should appear automatically → Fill in the values
2. If the popup doesn't appear: 
   - Go to the **Variables** tab at the top of your assistant
   - Fill in the required fields
   - Click **Save**

## How to Find Your API Key

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Webflow">
    ### Webflow API Key
    
    **Finding Your API Key:**

    2. Sign in with your Google account
    3. Grant the requested permissions

## General Tips for Finding API Keys

**Common locations across platforms:**
- Settings → Integrations → API
- Settings → Developer → API Keys  
- Settings → Security → API Access
- Account Settings → API & Integrations
- Developer Portal → API Credentials

**What to look for:**
- Usually called "API Key", "API Token", "Access Token", or "Secret Key"
- Long string of random letters, numbers, and symbols
- Often starts with a prefix (e.g., `sk_`, `secret_`, `Bearer `)

**Security best practices:**
- ✅ Never share your API key publicly
- ✅ Copy it immediately - some platforms only show it once
- ✅ Store it securely (Relevance AI encrypts it automatically)
- ✅ Revoke old keys if you're no longer using them
- ❌ Don't commit API keys to GitHub or public code

**Troubleshooting:**
- Can't find API settings? Look for "Developer", "Advanced", or "Integrations" sections
- Key not working? Check if it has the right permissions/scopes
- Still stuck? Contact the integration's support team for help locating API settings
