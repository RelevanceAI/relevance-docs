## Step 1: Find Your Assistant

1. Navigate to the [**Marketplace**](https://app.relevanceai.com/marketplace/f1db6c/0fff163c-daae-4d17-b878-0b4b4d4d902c) in Relevance AI
2. Search for "assistant" in the search bar to view all available Relevance AI Assistants
3. Look for the platform name with "Assistant" in the title (e.g., "Webflow Assistant", "Notion Assistant")
4. Click the **Clone** button

## Step 2: Configure Your Assistant

<Warning>
**CRITICAL SETUP - Complete this BEFORE first use**

You must add your API credentials before using your assistant, otherwise you'll see authentication errors.
</Warning>

### Configuration Checklist

After cloning your assistant, you'll need to provide:

- **API Key** - A special access token from your integration (see instructions below)
- **Site/Account ID** - Your specific workspace or site identifier
- **Documentation** - Pre-loaded (leave as-is, don't modify)

### What is an API Key?

Think of an API key as a **secure password** that lets the AI assistant access your account on your behalf. It's like giving the assistant a special key to your workspace so it can create, update, and manage things for you—without needing your actual login password.

**Why you need it:**
- The assistant needs permission to make changes in your account
- API keys are safer than sharing your password
- You can revoke the key anytime if needed

**How to Find Your API Key:**

<Note>
**API keys are managed by the external platform provider** (Webflow, Notion, HubSpot, etc.), not within Relevance AI. You'll need to navigate to your account on the respective platform to generate or locate your API key. Each platform has its own API documentation and guides—if you need additional help, search for "[Platform Name] API key" (e.g., "Webflow API key") to find official setup guides and support resources.
</Note>

### Where to Add These

1. After cloning, a setup popup should appear automatically → Fill in the values
2. If the popup doesn't appear: 
   - Go to the **Variables** tab at the top of your assistant
   - Fill in the required fields
   - Click **Save**
