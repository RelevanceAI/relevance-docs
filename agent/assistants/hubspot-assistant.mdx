## HubSpot Assistant Limitations

The HubSpot Assistant is designed specifically for **core CRM database operations** and includes specialized tools to handle HubSpot's specific requirements:

- **Date Range Formatting** - Uses a dedicated tool to convert dates to Unix timestamp format required by HubSpot's API
- **Math Calculations** - Uses a specialized math tool for accurate numerical operations like lead scoring, revenue calculations, and date arithmetic

The assistant focuses on managing contacts, companies, deals, tickets, engagements, properties, and associations. Platform features like workflows, marketing emails, sales sequences, and CMS are outside its scope.
