## Memory in Action

Because the HubSpot Wizard has memory enabled, it gets significantly faster and more efficient as you use it.

- Attempt 2: Finds correct property name for job title
- Attempt 3: Locates the Q1 Prospects list

**Time:** ~18 seconds | **Credits:** ~180

### After Learning

**What happens:**
- Retrieves the learned pattern from memory
- Executes the entire workflow successfully in one pass

## Built-in Helper Tools

The HubSpot Wizard includes specialized tools for common challenges:

### Date Range Formatter

Handles HubSpot's specific date format requirements:
- Converts natural language dates ("last 30 days", "this quarter") to HubSpot timestamp format
- Manages timezone conversions
- Calculates date ranges for reporting

### Math & Calculations

Performs calculations needed for:
- Lead scoring updates
- Revenue calculations
- Date arithmetic (days since last contact, etc.)
- Threshold comparisons

### Property Name Mapping

- Finds correct internal property names from natural language
- Handles custom property lookups
- Manages standard vs. custom property differences

<Note>
These tools work automatically in the background. You don't need to use them directly—the assistant calls them when needed.
</Note>

## Tips for Best Results

<Tip>
**Be specific about property names:**

Good: "Update the 'Lead Score' property to 85"

Better: If you're not sure of exact names, describe what you want and let the assistant find the right property
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Use consistent terminology:**

For memory to work best, always refer to lists, properties, and stages the same way:
- "Q1 Prospects" not sometimes "First Quarter Prospects"
- "Marketing Qualified Lead" not "MQL" or "Marketing Lead"
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Leverage memory for repeated tasks:**

If you frequently create contacts with the same custom properties, do it 2-3 times. The assistant will learn the pattern and subsequent tasks will be much faster.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Break down very complex operations:**

Instead of one giant request with 10 steps, break into logical phases:
1. "Find and tag the contacts"
2. "Enroll tagged contacts in workflow"
3. "Create follow-up tasks"
</Tip>

---

## What the Assistant Can't Do

Due to HubSpot API limitations, the assistant currently cannot:

- Modify certain locked system properties
- Delete objects (can archive instead)
- Access some reporting features (use HubSpot Reports for complex analytics)
- Modify workflow configurations (can enroll/unenroll but not edit workflows)
- Send emails directly (can create drafts or trigger workflows)
- Import files or attachments

<Note>
Most CRM operations ARE supported. The assistant excels at managing contacts, deals, companies, and automating routine tasks.
</Note>

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Property not found" errors

**Cause:** Using display name instead of internal property name, or property doesn't exist

**Solution:**
- First ask: "What properties are available for contacts?"
- Use the exact property name from the results
- Or describe what you want and let the assistant find the right property

### "Insufficient permissions" errors

**Cause:** API key or Private App doesn't have required scopes

**Solution:**
1. Check your HubSpot subscription includes the feature
2. Verify API key has necessary permissions
3. For advanced features, create a Private App with specific scopes
4. Go to Settings → Integrations → Private Apps → Configure scopes

### "Contact/Company not found"

**Solution:**
- Use email address for contacts (most reliable identifier)
- Use exact company name or company ID
- Try searching first: "Find contact with name 'John Smith'" then reference the ID

### Tasks take longer than expected

**First time is normal:** The assistant is learning your HubSpot setup (custom properties, lists, etc.)

**After several uses:** Memory kicks in and tasks become much faster

## Pricing & Credits

The HubSpot Wizard uses credits based on:
- Task complexity
- Number of API calls required
- Memory usage (minimal)

**Typical credit costs:**
- Simple tasks (get contact, list deals): ~10-50 credits
- Medium tasks (create with properties): ~50-150 credits
- Complex tasks (multi-stage workflows): ~150-400 credits

**With memory learning:**
- First time: Higher cost (150-200 credits)
- After learning: 60-70% reduction (40-80 credits)

<Tip>
The more you use the assistant for similar tasks, the more efficient it becomes through memory learning!
