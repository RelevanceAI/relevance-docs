# Troubleshooting AI Assistants

Having issues with your AI assistant? This guide covers the most common problems and how to fix them quickly.

<Tip>
**Most issues are setup-related** and can be resolved in under 2 minutes by checking your API key configuration.
</Tip>

---

## Setup & Authentication Errors

These are the most common issues users face when first setting up their assistant.

### "Authentication Failed" / "401 Unauthorized"

<Warning>
**This is the #1 most common error** - it means your API key is missing, incorrect, or expired.
</Warning>

![Authentication error example](/images/assistant-auth-error.png)

**Cause:** API key not configured correctly

**Solutions:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the Variables tab">
    1. Open your assistant
    2. Click the **Variables** tab at the top
    3. Verify the API key field is filled in (not empty)
    4. Check for extra spaces or characters
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify the API key is valid">
    1. Go to your integration's dashboard (Webflow, Notion, etc.)
    2. Navigate to API settings
    3. Check if the key still exists and is active
    4. Copy the key again and paste into Variables tab
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate a new API key">
    If the key is old or you're not sure it's correct:
    1. Generate a new API key in your integration's settings
    2. Copy it immediately (most platforms only show it once!)
    3. Paste into the Variables tab
    4. Save and test again
  </Step>
</Steps>

### "Site Not Found" / "Workspace Not Found" / "404 Error"

**Cause:** Site ID, Account ID, or Workspace ID is incorrect or missing

**Solutions:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Webflow">
    **Check your Site ID:**
    1. Open Webflow → Your site → Project Settings
    2. Go to **General** tab
    3. Copy the **Site ID** (long alphanumeric string)
    4. Paste into `site_id` field in Variables tab
    5. Make sure it matches the account your API key belongs to
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Notion">
    **Verify page/database sharing:**
    
    Notion requires an extra step beyond the API key!
    
    1. Open the page or database in Notion
    2. Click **Share** (top-right)
    3. Invite your integration by name
    4. Grant it access
    
    Without sharing, the assistant can't see your content even with a valid API key.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Salesforce">
    **Check your domain:**
    
    The domain should match your Salesforce instance:
    - Format: `yourcompany.my.salesforce.com`
    - Don't include `https://`
    - Find it in your browser URL when logged into Salesforce
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

### "Permission Denied" / "403 Forbidden"

**Cause:** API key doesn't have the necessary permissions/scopes

**Solutions:**

1. **Regenerate API key with full permissions:**
   - Most integrations let you specify permissions when creating keys
   - Ensure "full access" or "read/write" permissions are granted
   
2. **Check your plan:**
   - Some features require specific subscription tiers
   - Example: Webflow CMS API requires a CMS plan
   - Verify your account has access to the features you're trying to use

3. **For Notion:** Make sure pages/databases are shared with the integration

4. **For HubSpot:** You may need a Private App token instead of a standard API key for certain operations

---

### "Invalid Credentials" / "Login Failed"

**For Salesforce specifically:**

**Cause:** Username, password, or security token is incorrect

**Solutions:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reset your security token">
    1. Go to Salesforce Setup
    2. Navigate to **Personal Information**
    3. Click **Reset My Security Token**
    4. Check your email for the new token
    5. Update in Variables tab
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify username and password">
    - Username: Your Salesforce login email
    - Password: Your Salesforce password (not security token)
    - These should be the same credentials you use to log in
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check your domain">
    - Should be: `yourcompany.my.salesforce.com`
    - Or your custom domain if you have one
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Task Execution Errors

These errors happen when the assistant tries to complete your task but encounters issues.

### "Could not complete task after multiple attempts"

**What's happening:** The assistant tried several approaches but couldn't figure out how to complete your request

**Common causes:**
- Task is too vague or ambiguous
- Task requires capabilities not available in the API
- Task is technically possible but complex

**Solutions:**

<Accordion title="For Non-Technical Users">
  **1. Simplify your request**
  
  Break complex tasks into smaller, specific steps:
  
  Instead of: "Set up my entire website"  
  Try: "Create a blog collection with title and content fields"
  
  Instead of: "Update all my content"  
  Try: "Update the heading on my homepage to say 'Welcome to ACME Corp'"
  
  **2. Add more details**
  
  Be specific about what you want:
  
  Instead of: "Create a page"  
  Try: "Create a Notion page called 'Weekly Meeting Notes' with sections for attendees, agenda, and action items"
  
  **3. Ask first, then act**
  
  If you're not sure what's possible:
  
  Step 1: "What fields are in my Blog collection?"  
  Step 2: "Add a blog post with [specific field values]"
  
  **4. Contact support**
  
  If you're stuck, [reach out to our team](/get-started/support) with:
  - What you asked the assistant to do
  - The error message you received
  - Your integration type (Webflow, Notion, etc.)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="For Technical Users">
  **1. Review the system prompt**
  
  - Go to your assistant settings
  - View the system instructions
  - Check if the documentation includes the endpoints you need
  
  **2. Check integration API documentation**
  
  - Visit the integration's official API docs
  - Verify the operation you're requesting is supported
  - Some features may not be available via API
  
  **3. Update the documentation variable**
  
  If you discover endpoints not in the docs:
  - Go to Variables tab
  - Find the `documentation` variable
  - Add the missing API endpoint information
  
  **4. Use ChatGPT to improve prompts**
  
  Copy your task + error message → Ask ChatGPT:
  "How can I rephrase this task for an AI assistant for better clarity?"
  
  **5. Check API limits**
  
  Some integrations have rate limits or restrictions:
  - Too many requests in a short time
  - File size limits
  - Character/content limits
</Accordion>

---

### "Timeout" / "Request took too long"

**Cause:** Task is taking longer than expected to complete

**Solutions:**

1. **Break down the task:** Split bulk operations into smaller batches
   - Instead of: "Update all 500 blog posts"
   - Try: "Update the first 50 blog posts where category is 'News'"

2. **Simplify the request:** Remove unnecessary complexity
   - Ask for what you need, not everything

3. **Try again:** Sometimes temporary network or API issues cause timeouts

---

### "Rate limit exceeded"

**Cause:** Too many API requests in a short time period

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait a few minutes** before trying again
2. **Reduce batch sizes** if doing bulk operations
3. **Spread out requests** over time
4. **Check your integration's rate limits** in their documentation

---

## Integration-Specific Issues

### Webflow

<Accordion title="Can't modify page design or styles">
  **This is expected behavior.**
  
  The Webflow Assistant uses the CMS API, which handles content only—not visual design.
  
  **Can do:** Manage collections, items, and content  
  **Can't do:** Change layouts, styles, fonts, or visual design
  
  For design changes, use the Webflow Designer directly.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Collection not found">
  **Solution:**
  1. Ask: "List all my collections"
  2. Use the exact collection name from the results
  3. Collection names are case-sensitive
</Accordion>

### Notion

<Accordion title="Can't access my pages or databases">
  **Most common issue:** Pages not shared with the integration
  
  **Solution:**
  1. Open the page/database in Notion
  2. Click **Share** (top-right)
  3. Find your integration by name
  4. Add it to the page
  
  You must do this for each page/database the assistant needs to access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can't create certain field types">
  Some advanced Notion field types have limited API support.
  
  Try creating the database manually in Notion first, then use the assistant to populate it.
</Accordion>

### Google Docs

<Accordion title="Can't add formatted content (tables, headers, etc.)">
  The standard Google Docs API has limitations with complex formatting.
  
  Some Google Docs assistants include a special **HTML formatting tool** to work around this.
  
  If your assistant has this tool, you can request:
  - "Create a document with a table showing [data]"
  - "Add a header and bullet list to [document]"
  
  The assistant will use the HTML tool automatically when needed.
</Accordion>

### Gmail

<Accordion title="Can't send emails">
  Gmail requires emails to be base64 encoded before sending.
  
  Most Gmail assistants include a **base64 encoding tool** that handles this automatically.
  
  If emails aren't sending, verify your assistant has this tool included.
</Accordion>

### HubSpot

<Accordion title="Date or calculation errors">
  HubSpot APIs have specific requirements for date formats and calculations.
  
  Advanced HubSpot assistants may include helper tools for:
  - Date range formatting
  - Mathematical calculations
  - Property value transformations
  
  These tools help the assistant handle complex data correctly.
</Accordion>

## When to Build a Custom Tool

<Note>
**Situation:** You keep asking the assistant to do the exact same task repeatedly, and it works every time.

**Consider:** Converting that workflow into a dedicated custom tool.
</Note>

### Benefits of Custom Tools

- **Faster execution** - No reasoning needed, runs immediately  
- **Lower credit costs** - More efficient than agent reasoning  
- **More reliable** - Consistent results every time  
- **Simpler inputs** - Just fill in a form  

### When to Use the Assistant Instead

- **Tasks vary each time** - Different parameters or approach needed  
- **Exploratory work** - Figuring out what's possible  
- **One-off tasks** - Not worth building a custom tool  
- **Complex decision-making** - Requires intelligence and adaptation  

### How to Convert to a Custom Tool

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete the task successfully">
    Use your assistant to complete the task at least once successfully
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View the task history">
    Open the completed task and review the API calls the assistant made
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a new tool">
    In Relevance AI, create a new tool/chain
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Replicate the API calls">
    Copy the successful API call sequence into your new tool
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add user inputs">
    Create input fields for the parts that change (e.g., title, content, etc.)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test and save">
    Run your new tool to verify it works consistently
  </Step>
</Steps>
