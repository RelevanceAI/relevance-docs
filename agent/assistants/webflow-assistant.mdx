## Built-in Tools

The Webflow Assistant includes one main tool:

### Generic API Call Tool
A flexible tool that can make any API call to the Webflow API. The assistant dynamically determines:
- Which endpoint to call
- What HTTP method to use (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- What data to include in the request body
- How to handle the response

You don't need to know anything about these technical details—just describe what you want!

## Troubleshooting

### Collection names are case-sensitive

When referencing collections, use the exact name (including capitalization) as it appears in Webflow.

**Tip:** If you're unsure, ask: "List all my collections" to see the exact names.

### Webflow API documentation

For advanced troubleshooting or to verify what's possible via the API, see the [Webflow API documentation](https://developers.webflow.com/reference/cms).
