## Built-in Tools

The Webflow Assistant includes one main tool:

### Generic API Call Tool
A flexible tool that can make any API call to the Webflow API. The assistant dynamically determines:
- Which endpoint to call
- What HTTP method to use (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- What data to include in the request body
- How to handle the response

You don't need to know anything about these technical details—just describe what you want!

---

## Common Use Cases

### Content Management
- **Blog management:** Create posts, update content, publish drafts
- **Portfolio updates:** Add new projects with images and details
- **Product catalogs:** Manage e-commerce collections
- **Team pages:** Update staff bios and photos

### Site Administration
- **Collection setup:** Create new content types and structures
- **Bulk operations:** Update multiple items at once
- **Data migration:** Move content between collections
- **Quality assurance:** Find and fix inconsistent data

### Workflow Automation
- **Scheduled publishing:** Publish content on a schedule
- **Content backups:** Export collection data
- **Multi-site management:** Update multiple Webflow sites
- **Integration workflows:** Connect Webflow with other tools

## Tips for Best Results

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Writing Requests">
    **1. Be specific with collection names**
    
    Always include the exact collection name in your request to avoid confusion.
    
    **Example:**
    - Good: "Add a blog post to my 'Company News' collection"
    - Avoid: "Add a post"
    
    ---
    
    **2. Use clear field names**
    
    If you're not sure what fields exist in a collection, ask the assistant first.
    
    **Example:** "What fields are in my Blog collection?"
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Data Requirements">
    **1. Provide all required field data**
    
    Include all the information needed to complete the task in one request. This helps the assistant create complete records without back-and-forth.
    
    **Example:**
    - Good: "Create a blog post with title 'Hello World', author 'Jane', and content 'Welcome to our blog...'"
    - Avoid: "Create a blog post" (missing required fields)
    
    ---
    
    **2. Check required fields first**
    
    If you're unsure what data is needed, ask the assistant about required fields before creating items.
    
    **Example:** "What are the required fields for the Blog collection?"
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Complex Tasks">
    **1. Break tasks into manageable steps**
    
    For very complex operations, split them into multiple sequential requests. This makes troubleshooting easier and improves success rates.
    
    **Example workflow:**
    - First: "Create a Portfolio collection with project name, client, and date fields"
    - Then: "Now add a new project to the Portfolio collection..."
    
    ---
    
    **2. Test before bulk operations**
    
    When working with multiple items, test your request on a single item first to ensure the format is correct.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## What the Assistant Can't Do

Due to Webflow API limitations, the assistant currently cannot:

- Design or modify page layouts visually  
- Change styles, fonts, or CSS  
- Modify the Designer canvas  
- Configure hosting or domain settings  
- Access Webflow Editor mode  

<Note>
The assistant works with the **Webflow CMS API**, which focuses on content management. For visual design changes, you'll need to use the Webflow Designer directly.
</Note>

---

## Troubleshooting

### Collection names are case-sensitive

When referencing collections, use the exact name (including capitalization) as it appears in Webflow.

**Tip:** If you're unsure, ask: "List all my collections" to see the exact names.

### Webflow API documentation

For advanced troubleshooting or to verify what's possible via the API, see the [Webflow API documentation](https://developers.webflow.com/reference/cms).

## Pricing & Credits

The Webflow Assistant uses credits based on:
- Complexity of the task
- Number of API calls required
- Length of API responses

**Typical credit costs:**
- Simple tasks (list collections): ~10-50 credits
- Medium tasks (create item): ~50-150 credits  
- Complex tasks (bulk operations): ~150-500 credits

<Tip>
The assistant automatically optimizes API responses to minimize credit usage while maintaining accuracy.
