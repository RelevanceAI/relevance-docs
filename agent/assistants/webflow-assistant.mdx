## Built-in Tools

The Webflow Assistant includes one main tool:

### Generic API Call Tool
A flexible tool that can make any API call to the Webflow API. The assistant dynamically determines:
- Which endpoint to call
- What HTTP method to use (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- What data to include in the request body
- How to handle the response

You don't need to know anything about these technical details—just describe what you want!

---

## Common Use Cases

### Content Management
- **Blog management:** Create posts, update content, publish drafts
- **Portfolio updates:** Add new projects with images and details
- **Product catalogs:** Manage e-commerce collections
- **Team pages:** Update staff bios and photos

### Site Administration
- **Collection setup:** Create new content types and structures
- **Bulk operations:** Update multiple items at once
- **Data migration:** Move content between collections
- **Quality assurance:** Find and fix inconsistent data

### Workflow Automation
- **Scheduled publishing:** Publish content on a schedule
- **Content backups:** Export collection data
- **Multi-site management:** Update multiple Webflow sites
- **Integration workflows:** Connect Webflow with other tools

## Tips for Best Results

<Tip>
**Be specific with collection names:** 
- ✅ Good: "Add a blog post to my 'Company News' collection"
- ❌ Vague: "Add a post"
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Provide all required field data:**
- ✅ Good: "Create a blog post with title 'Hello World', author 'Jane', and content 'Welcome...'"
- ❌ Incomplete: "Create a blog post"
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Use clear field names:**
If you're not sure what fields exist, ask first: "What fields are in my Blog collection?"
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Break complex tasks into steps:**
For very complex operations, you can either describe everything at once or break it into multiple requests:
1. "Create the collection structure"
2. "Now add items to it"
</Tip>

## What the Assistant Can't Do

Due to Webflow API limitations, the assistant currently cannot:

❌ Design or modify page layouts visually  
❌ Change styles, fonts, or CSS  
❌ Modify the Designer canvas  
❌ Configure hosting or domain settings  
❌ Access Webflow Editor mode  

<Note>
The assistant works with the **Webflow CMS API**, which focuses on content management. For visual design changes, you'll need to use the Webflow Designer directly.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" or "401 Unauthorized"

**Cause:** API key is missing, incorrect, or expired

**Solution:**
1. Go to Variables tab in your assistant
2. Verify `webflow_api_key` is filled in correctly
3. Check that your API key is still active in Webflow
4. Generate a new key if needed and update in Variables tab

### "Site not found" or "404 Error"

**Cause:** Site ID is incorrect or doesn't match your API key

**Solution:**
1. Verify your Site ID in Webflow Project Settings
2. Ensure you're using the Site ID that matches the API key's account
3. Update `site_id` in Variables tab

### "Permission denied" or "403 Forbidden"

**Cause:** API key doesn't have sufficient permissions

**Solution:**
1. Check your Webflow plan - some features require specific plans
2. Verify the API key has full access permissions
3. Try generating a new API key with full permissions

### Assistant can't find a collection

**Solution:**
1. First ask: "List all my collections"
2. Use the exact collection name returned
3. Or provide the collection ID directly

### Task fails after multiple attempts

**Solution:**
1. Simplify your request - break it into smaller steps
2. Check if the task is supported by Webflow API
3. Review the [Webflow API documentation](https://developers.webflow.com/reference/cms)
4. Contact support for assistance

- Length of API responses

**Typical credit costs:**
- Simple tasks (list collections): ~10-50 credits
- Medium tasks (create item): ~50-150 credits  
- Complex tasks (bulk operations): ~150-500 credits

<Tip>
The assistant automatically optimizes API responses to minimize credit usage while maintaining accuracy.
