## How It Works

The Google Slides Assistant does all the heavy lifting in the background—you just describe what you need in plain English, and it handles the rest.

**Automatic Operations**
- Constructs precise API calls using documentation (doesn't guess)
- Retries failed operations up to 3 times with adjustments
- Searches all drives for presentations and distinguishes between created vs shared
- Returns clickable links to presentations

**Smart Features**
- Generates max 1 image per request, never on title pages unless asked
- Re-uses content when retrying to avoid recreating from scratch
- Creates branded title pages with brand background and white text automatically

**Built-In Safety**
- Always asks for explicit confirmation before destructive operations
- Prevents incomplete presentations from being returned if creation fails

## What the Assistant Can't Do

Due to Google Slides API limitations, the assistant cannot:

- **Complex visual designs**: Cannot create advanced themes or custom layouts
- **Animations and transitions**: Cannot add slide animations or transitions
- **Charts and graphs**: Limited to creating placeholders, not functional charts
- **Speaker notes**: Limited support for adding speaker notes
- **Master slide editing**: Cannot modify master slide templates
- **Advanced formatting**: Limited support for complex colors, fonts, and styling beyond basics

<Note>
The assistant excels at **creating structured presentations and adding text content**. For complex visual design, custom themes, and advanced formatting, you may need to use Google Slides directly after the assistant creates the initial presentation.
</Note>
