## What the Assistant Can't Do

Due to Google Slides API limitations, the assistant may have limitations with:

- Complex visual designs and themes
- Images and media (can add image URLs in some cases)
- Charts and graphs (can create placeholders)
- Animations and transitions
- Speaker notes (limited support)
- Master slide editing
- Advanced formatting (colors, fonts beyond basics)

<Note>
The assistant works best for **creating structure and adding text content**. For complex visual design and branding, you'll need to use Google Slides directly.
</Note>

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Presentation not found"

**Cause:** Presentation name incorrect or you don't have access

**Solution:**
- First list presentations: "Show me all my presentations"
- Use the exact presentation name from the list
- Or provide the presentation ID from the URL

### "Permission denied"

**Cause:** OAuth connection doesn't have sufficient permissions

**Solution:**
1. Reconnect your Google account
2. Ensure you grant all requested permissions (Slides + Drive)
3. Check that you own or have edit access to the presentation

### Slides don't have expected layout

**Cause:** API creates basic layouts by default

**Solution:**
- Focus on content rather than complex layouts
- Use Google Slides directly for layout adjustments
- The assistant creates functional slides that you can format manually

### Content not appearing correctly

**Cause:** Text placement limitations in API

**Solution:**
- Keep text content simple and structured
- Use bullet points and headings
- Avoid complex multi-column layouts
- Format manually after creation if needed

---

## Working with Presentation IDs

Google Slides can be referenced by name or ID:

**Presentation ID Location:**
The ID is in the URL:
```
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/PRESENTATION_ID_HERE/edit
```

**When to use IDs:**
- When you have multiple presentations with similar names
- For more reliable targeting
- When working programmatically

**Example:**
```
"Add a slide to presentation ID 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j"
```

---

## Credit Cost Optimization

The Google Slides Assistant saw massive cost reductions through API result minification:

**Before optimization:**
- Creating a presentation: ~1,830 credits
- High token consumption from full API responses

**After optimization:**
- Creating a presentation: ~41 credits
- 98% reduction in costs!

<Tip>
Slides operations are now very efficient. Even creating complex multi-slide presentations typically costs under 100 credits.
</Tip>

## Presentation Sharing & Permissions

The assistant can work with presentations you own or have edit access to:

**What you can do:**
- Create new presentations (always owned by you)
- Edit presentations you own
- Edit shared presentations where you have edit permission

**What you can't do:**
- Edit presentations where you only have view/comment access
- Access presentations not shared with your Google account
- Modify sharing settings programmatically

---

## Best Practices

**Presentation Planning:**
- Plan slide structure before creating
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Create templates for recurring presentation types

**Content Strategy:**
- Keep text concise and bullet-pointed
- Use clear slide titles
- One main idea per slide

**Template Usage:**
- Create master templates for common needs
- Copy templates rather than recreating structure
- Maintain template library in organized folder

**Batch Creation:**
- Create multiple similar presentations in one request
- Use consistent structure across batch
- Customize after creation if needed

---

## Google Drive Integration

Google Slides Assistant works with Google Drive:

**Storage:**
All presentations are stored in your Google Drive

**Organization:**
- Presentations can be organized in Drive folders
- Use Drive Assistant for folder operations
- Reference by name or ID

**Collaboration:**
- Presentations can be shared like any Drive file
- Sharing is managed in Google Drive/Slides
- Assistant works with any presentation you can edit
