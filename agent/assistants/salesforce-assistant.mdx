## Memory in Action

Because the Salesforce Assistant has memory enabled, it gets significantly faster and more efficient as you use it.

### First Time Example

**Your request:** "Create an opportunity for ACME Corp valued at $100K, closing end of Q2, stage 'Proposal Sent', with custom field 'Product Interest' set to 'Enterprise Plan'"

**What happens:**
- Attempt 1: Creates basic opportunity
- Attempt 2: Finds custom field API name for 'Product Interest'
- Attempt 3: Associates with account
- Attempt 4: Sets all properties successfully
- **Saves the successful workflow to memory**

**Time:** ~22 seconds | **Credits:** ~210

### After Learning

**Your request:** "Create an opportunity for GlobalTech valued at $75K, closing next month, stage 'Qualification', Product Interest 'Professional Plan'"

**What happens:**
- Retrieves the learned pattern from memory
- Executes the entire workflow successfully in one pass
- All custom fields mapped correctly

**Time:** ~5 seconds | **Credits:** ~60

**Improvement:** 77% faster, 71% cheaper!

## Built-in Helper Tools

The Salesforce Assistant includes specialized tools for common challenges:

### Date & Time Management

Handles Salesforce's datetime requirements:
- Converts natural language dates to Salesforce format
- Manages timezone conversions
- Calculates date ranges for queries (last 30 days, this quarter, etc.)
- Handles fiscal year vs. calendar year

### SOQL Query Builder

Constructs Salesforce Object Query Language queries:
- Builds queries from natural language descriptions
- Handles complex filtering and relationships
- Manages field selection and limits
- Optimizes for performance

### Custom Field Mapper

Maps between field labels and API names:
- Finds internal API names from user-friendly labels
- Handles standard vs. custom field differences
- Manages namespace prefixes
- Validates field types

<Note>
These tools work automatically in the background. You don't need to use them directly—the assistant calls them when needed.
</Note>

## Tips for Best Results

<Tip>
**Use consistent naming:**

For memory to work best, always refer to custom fields, record types, and objects the same way. The assistant will learn your terminology patterns.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Provide object context:**

Good: "Create an opportunity for account 'ACME Corp'"

Better: "Create an opportunity for account 'ACME Corp' (account ID: 001...)" if you have the ID
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Leverage memory for custom fields:**

If you frequently work with custom fields, use them 2-3 times and the assistant will learn their API names and requirements.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Break down complex queries:**

Instead of one massive query, break into logical steps:
1. "Find accounts matching criteria"
2. "For these accounts, update fields"
3. "Create follow-up tasks"
</Tip>

---

## What the Assistant Can't Do

Due to Salesforce API limitations, the assistant currently cannot:

- Delete records permanently (can mark for deletion in some cases)
- Modify certain system fields (Created Date, Owner change restrictions, etc.)
- Access some reporting features (use Salesforce Reports for complex analytics)
- Modify page layouts or field-level security
- Create or modify workflows, process builders, or flows
- Send emails directly (can create tasks or log activities)
- Upload files or attachments directly

<Note>
Most CRM operations ARE supported. The assistant excels at managing records, automating routine tasks, and data operations.
</Note>

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Field does not exist" errors

**Cause:** Using field label instead of API name, or field doesn't exist

**Solution:**
- First ask: "What fields are available on the Account object?"
- Use the exact API name from the results
- Remember custom fields end with `__c`

### "Insufficient access rights" errors

**Cause:** User doesn't have permission to access object or field

**Solution:**
1. Check your Salesforce profile permissions
2. Verify you have edit rights on the object
3. Check field-level security settings
4. Contact your Salesforce admin if needed

### "Entity is deleted" errors

**Cause:** Trying to access a record that's been deleted or in the recycle bin

**Solution:**
- Verify the record ID is correct
- Check if record is in the recycle bin
- Use a different record ID

### Security token issues

**Cause:** Security token expired or incorrect

**Solution:**
1. Reset your security token in Salesforce Setup
2. Check your email for the new token
3. Update the token in Variables tab
4. Try the task again

### Tasks take longer than expected

**First time is normal:** The assistant is learning your Salesforce org's custom fields and structure

**After several uses:** Memory kicks in and tasks become much faster

---

## Working with Custom Objects

The Salesforce Assistant can work with your custom objects:

**Example:**
```
"Create a record in the 'Project__c' custom object with Name 'Website Redesign', 
Status__c 'In Progress', Budget__c 50000, and relate it to account 'ACME Corp'"
```

**Tips for custom objects:**
- Always include the `__c` suffix for custom object names
- Custom field names also need `__c` suffix
- Describe relationships clearly (lookup to Account, master-detail to Contact, etc.)
- The assistant will learn your custom object structure through memory

---

## Pricing & Credits

The Salesforce Assistant uses credits based on:
- Task complexity
- Number of API calls required
- SOQL query complexity
- Memory usage (minimal)

**Typical credit costs:**
- Simple tasks (get account, list opportunities): ~10-50 credits
- Medium tasks (create with fields): ~50-150 credits
- Complex tasks (multi-stage workflows): ~150-400 credits

**With memory learning:**
- First time: Higher cost (180-220 credits)
- After learning: 60-75% reduction (50-90 credits)

<Tip>
The more you use the assistant for similar tasks, the more efficient it becomes through memory learning!
</Tip>

---

## Salesforce Editions & Limits

**API Access:**
- Professional Edition: Limited API calls (often requires API access add-on)
- Enterprise Edition: Full API access included
- Unlimited Edition: Highest API limits

**API Call Limits:**
The assistant is designed to minimize API calls, but be aware of your org's daily limits. The assistant will inform you if you're approaching limits.
