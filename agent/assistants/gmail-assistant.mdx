## How It Works

The Gmail Assistant handles complex email operations automatically:

**Smart Email Sending**
- Automatically retrieves your sender email address using your Gmail account ID
- Converts email content to base64-encoded format for Gmail API compatibility
- Handles HTML formatting for subject lines and email bodies
- Manages attachment encoding and MIME types seamlessly

**Intelligent Label Management**
- Checks if labels exist before applying them
- Creates missing labels automatically when needed
- Uses actual label names (not IDs) for natural interactions

**Built-In Error Recovery**
- Consults Gmail API documentation to ensure accuracy
- Automatically retries failed operations up to 3 times
- Adapts approach based on error messages
- Provides clear feedback on what went wrong and how it's being fixed

**Full Content Retrieval**
- Gets complete email bodies, not just thread IDs
- Retrieves all metadata and headers
- Handles query strings as URL parameters automatically

## What the Assistant Can't Do

Due to Gmail API limitations, the assistant cannot:

- **Modify Gmail settings**: Cannot change filters, forwarding rules, or account settings
- **Access Google Chat messages**: Only Gmail emails are accessible
- **Create automated rules/filters**: Can suggest them but cannot implement auto-filters
- **Permanently delete emails**: Can move to trash, but cannot bypass trash (safety feature)
- **Modify email content after sending**: Sent emails cannot be edited
- **Access other Google Workspace apps**: Limited to Gmail only (unless separately integrated)

<Note>
The assistant excels at the complete email workflow: **searching with full content retrieval, organizing, labeling, composing, and sending emails**. HTML formatting and attachments are fully supported.
</Note>
