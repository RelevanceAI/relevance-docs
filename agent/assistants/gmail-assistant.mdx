## Common Use Cases

December 15th and had a spreadsheet attachment"
```

the website project"
```

## Built-in Helper Tools

The Gmail Assistant includes a specialized tool for certain operations:

### Base64 Email Encoder

Required for sending emails through Gmail API:
- Converts email content to proper format
- Handles attachments encoding
- Manages MIME type formatting

<Note>
Currently, the Gmail Assistant is optimized for **reading and organizing** emails. Sending/composing is available but may require additional configuration. Focus on search, label management, and organization tasks for best results.
</Note>

---

## Tips for Best Results

<Tip>
**Use specific search criteria:**

Good: "Find emails from john@example.com sent last week with 'proposal' in subject"

This is more effective than: "Find John's emails"
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Leverage Gmail's search syntax:**

The assistant understands natural language, but can also work with Gmail operators:
- "Emails from:john@example.com after:2024/01/01"
- "Larger than 10MB with attachments"
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Organize with labels, not folders:**

Gmail uses labels (tags) not folders. You can apply multiple labels to one email.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Break down bulk operations:**

Instead of "organize my entire inbox," try:
1. "Find and label client emails from last quarter"
2. "Archive old promotional emails"
3. "Create project-based labels for active projects"
</Tip>

---

## What the Assistant Can't Do

Due to Gmail API limitations and current implementation, the assistant may have limitations with:

- Composing and sending complex formatted emails (plain text works better)
- Modifying Gmail settings (filters, forwarding, etc.)
- Accessing Google Chat messages
- Creating automated rules/filters (can suggest them)
- Permanently deleting emails (can move to trash)
- Modifying email content after sending

<Note>
The assistant excels at **searching, organizing, and managing** existing emails. These are the primary use cases it's optimized for.
</Note>

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" or "Permission denied"

**Cause:** OAuth connection expired or insufficient permissions

**Solution:**
1. Reconnect your Google account in the assistant
2. Ensure you granted all requested permissions
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting if issues persist

### "Email not found"

**Cause:** Search criteria too specific or email doesn't exist

**Solution:**
- Broaden your search criteria
- Try searching by sender email instead of name
- Check if email is in trash or spam

### "Too many results"

**Cause:** Search returned more emails than can be processed at once

**Solution:**
- Add more specific criteria (date range, sender, subject keywords)
- Break into smaller searches: "emails from January" then "emails from February"

### Rate limiting errors

**Cause:** Too many API requests in short time

**Solution:**
- Wait a few minutes before trying again
- Break bulk operations into smaller batches
- Reduce scope of search/organization tasks

---

**By Sender/Recipient:**
- `from:john@example.com` - From specific sender
- `to:sarah@example.com` - Sent to specific recipient
- `cc:team@company.com` - CC'd to address

**By Date:**
- `after:2024/01/01` - After specific date
- `before:2024/12/31` - Before specific date
- `older_than:6m` - Older than 6 months

**By Content:**
- `subject:invoice` - Subject contains word
- `has:attachment` - Has any attachment
- `filename:pdf` - Has PDF attachment
- `larger:10M` - Larger than 10MB

**By Status:**
- `is:unread` - Unread emails
- `is:starred` - Starred emails
- `is:important` - Marked important
- `label:follow-up` - Has specific label

**Combinations:**
```
"from:client@example.com after:2024/01/01 has:attachment subject:proposal"
```

---

## Pricing & Credits

The Gmail Assistant uses credits based on:
- Number of emails searched
- Complexity of operations
- Bulk operation size

**Typical credit costs:**
- Simple search (list recent emails): ~10-30 credits
- Label management (create/apply labels): ~20-50 credits
