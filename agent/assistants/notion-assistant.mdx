## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone from Marketplace">
    Search "Notion" in the Marketplace and click Clone
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Notion Integration">
    **Creating your integration token:**
    1. Go to [www.notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
    2. Click **+ New Integration**
    3. Give it a name (e.g., "Relevance AI Assistant")
    4. Select the workspace you want to connect
    5. Click **Submit**
    6. Copy the **Internal Integration Token** (starts with `secret_`)
    7. Paste into `notion_api_key` field in Variables tab
    
    ![Notion integration creation](/images/notion-create-integration.png)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Share Pages with Integration">
    **CRITICAL STEP:** You must share pages/databases with your integration!
    
    For each page or database you want the assistant to access:
    1. Open the page/database in Notion
    2. Click **Share** (top-right corner)
    3. Search for your integration name
    4. Click to add it
    
    **Without this step, the assistant cannot see or modify your content.**
    
    ![Sharing Notion page with integration](/images/notion-share-integration.png)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test It">
    Try: "Create a blank page called 'Test Notes'"
    
    If successful, you'll see confirmation with the page ID!
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Important:** Notion requires you to explicitly share pages/databases with your integration. The assistant can only access what you've shared with it.
</Warning>

<Note>
For detailed setup instructions, see the [Quick Start Guide](/agent/assistants/assistants-quickstart#notion)

## Showcase: Task Management System

One of the most impressive demonstrations of the Notion Assistant is its ability to create complete systems from a single instruction.

**Request:** "Create a project management system with linked databases for projects and tasks"

**What it creates:**

### Projects Database
- Name (Title)
- Status (Select: Not Started, In Progress, Completed, On Hold)
- Owner (Person)
- Start Date (Date)
- End Date (Date)
- Related Tasks (Relation to Tasks database)

### Tasks Database
- Task Name (Title)
- Description (Text)
- Assignee (Person)
- Due Date (Date)
- Status (Select: To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Priority (Select: Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
- Project (Relation to Projects database)

**Time to create:** Under 30 seconds  
**What you'd have built:** A complete, functional project management system with bidirectional relationships

## Tips for Best Results

<Tip>
**Be explicit about property types:**

Good: "Create a database with Name (title), Status (select with options: New/Active/Done), and Due Date (date property)"

This ensures the assistant creates exactly the structure you need.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Specify relationships clearly:**

Good: "Link the Tasks database to Projects database with a relation property called 'Project'"

This helps the assistant set up bidirectional links correctly.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Include sample data when useful:**

"...and add 3 sample tasks to show how it works"

Sample data helps you see the structure immediately.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Break down very complex requests:**

Instead of: "Build my entire workspace"

Try: 
1. "Create the main databases"
2. "Add the relationships between them"
3. "Create the page structure"
4. "Add sample content"
</Tip>

---

## What the Assistant Can't Do

Due to Notion API limitations, the assistant currently cannot:

- Create or modify visual layouts (column arrangements, etc.)
- Work with pages/databases not shared with the integration
- Access inline databases within pages (must be full-page databases)
- Modify workspace settings or permissions
- Create views within databases (default view only)
- Add images or files directly (can add URLs)

<Note>
Most content and structure operations ARE supported. The assistant excels at creating databases, managing data, and organizing information.
</Note>

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Page not found" / "Database not found"

**Cause:** The page/database hasn't been shared with your integration

**Solution:**
1. Open the page/database in Notion
2. Click **Share** (top-right)
3. Add your integration to the page
4. Try the task again

This is the most common Notion-specific issue!

### "Insufficient permissions"

**Cause:** Integration doesn't have the right capabilities

**Solution:**
1. Go to [notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click on your integration
3. Check capabilities: "Read content", "Update content", "Insert content"
4. Save changes and try again

### "Cannot create database"

**Cause:** Trying to create inline database or in unshared location

**Solution:**
- Specify creating a "full-page database" in your workspace root
- Or share the parent page where you want the database created

### Can't find recently created items

**Cause:** Items were created but page not refreshed

**Solution:**
- Refresh Notion in your browser
- Items may take a few seconds to appear in Notion's UI

---

## Advanced Features

### Relational Databases

The Notion Assistant excels at creating complex relational structures:

**Example:**
```
"Create a project management system with Projects, Tasks, and Team Members databases. 
Link tasks to projects, and tasks to team members (assignee). 
Add properties for start/end dates, status, and priority."
```

The assistant will:
- Create all three databases
- Set up bidirectional relations
- Configure properties correctly
- Demonstrate with sample data

### Bulk Operations

Process multiple items efficiently:

**Examples:**
- "Update all tasks assigned to John to change assignee to Sarah"
- "Archive all completed projects from 2023"
- "Add a 'Q1' tag to all tasks with due dates in January-March"

### Template Creation

Build reusable page templates:

**Example:**
```
"Create a meeting notes template with sections for Date, Attendees, Agenda, 
Discussion Points, Decisions, and Action Items with placeholders"
```

---

## Pricing & Credits

The Notion Assistant uses credits based on:
- Complexity of the task
- Number of API calls required
- Amount of content created

**Typical credit costs:**
- Simple tasks (create page, list databases): ~10-50 credits
- Medium tasks (create database with properties): ~50-150 credits
- Complex tasks (complete systems with relations): ~150-500 credits

<Tip>
The assistant automatically optimizes API responses to minimize credit usage while maintaining accuracy.
