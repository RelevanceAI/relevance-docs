## What Can the Notion Assistant Build?

Here's a real example of what the assistant created from a single, simple request—no technical knowledge required.

<Accordion title="See the complete example: Task Management System">
  ### The Request
  
  "Build a complete task management system in Notion. Create a page called 'Task Management System'. Inside that, create a 'Projects' database with properties: Name (title), Status (select: 'Active', 'On Hold', 'Completed'), Owner (person), and Due Date (date). Then create a 'Tasks' database with properties: Task Name (title), Status (select: 'Not Started', 'In Progress', 'Blocked', 'Done'), Priority (select), Project (relation to 'Projects'), and Assignee (person). Link the two databases via a relation, and create three sample projects and 10 tasks distributed among them."

  ### What the Notion Assistant Created
  
  #### Projects Database
  
  | Project | Status | Due Date |
  |---------|---------|----------|
  | Marketing Campaign | Completed | July 31, 2025 |
  | Mobile App Launch | On Hold | September 1, 2025 |
  | Website Redesign | Active | August 15, 2025 |
  
  #### Tasks Database (Sample)
  
  | Task | Project | Priority | Status |
  |------|---------|----------|---------|
  | QA review | Website Redesign | Medium | Not Started |
  | Design email template | Marketing Campaign | Low | Not Started |
  | Schedule social posts | Marketing Campaign | Medium | Done |
  | Create ad copy | Marketing Campaign | High | Done |
  | Beta testing | Mobile App Launch | Medium | In Progress |
  | App store submission | Mobile App Launch | High | Not Started |
  | Write user documentation | Website Redesign | Low | Blocked |
  | Develop login system | Website Redesign | Medium | Not Started |
  | Design homepage | Website Redesign | High | In Progress |
  
  **Plus:** All databases are linked with bidirectional relationships, so projects show their related tasks and tasks link back to their projects.

  ### Behind the Scenes
  
  The assistant made **16 API calls** in the background to build this complete system—all automatically figured out and executed.
  
  **Manual time saved:** 15-20 minutes of clicking through Notion's interface
</Accordion>

**What makes this impressive:**
- The assistant understood the complex request and broke it into logical steps
- Made 16 sequential API calls automatically to build everything
- Created both databases with proper field types and configurations
- Generated realistic sample data (3 projects, 10 tasks)
- Established relationships between the databases automatically
- Saved significant manual work—all from a single natural language instruction

## Tips for Best Results

---

**Be explicit about property types** - Specify field types to ensure accuracy  
*Example: "Create a database with Name (title), Status (select: New/Active/Done), and Due Date (date property)"*

---

**Specify relationships clearly** - Describe how databases should connect  
*Example: "Link the Tasks database to Projects with a relation property called 'Project'"*

---

**Include sample data** - Ask for examples to see the structure immediately  
*Example: "...and add 3 sample tasks to show how it works"*

---

**Break down complex requests** - Split large projects into steps  
*Example: First "Create the main databases" then "Add relationships" then "Add sample content"*

## What the Notion Assistant Can't Do

Due to Notion API limitations, the assistant currently cannot:

- Create or modify visual layouts (column arrangements, etc.)
- Work with pages/databases not shared with the integration
- Access inline databases within pages (must be full-page databases)
- Modify workspace settings or permissions
- Create views within databases (default view only)
- Add images or files directly (can add URLs)

<Note>
Most content and structure operations ARE supported. The assistant excels at creating databases, managing data, and organizing information.
