# What are AI Assistants?

AI Assistants understand what you want to achieve and automatically figure out the steps needed to get it done. Just describe your task in natural language, and watch the assistant handle the technical details behind the scenes.

**Example:**
- **You say:** "Create a project tracker in Notion with tasks, owners, and due dates"
- **Assistant does:** Creates databases, sets up relationships, adds fields, and configures views—automatically

## AI Assistants vs. Agents

  <Card title="AI Assistants" icon="store">
    Pre-built agents optimized for specific platforms with generic API tools
    
    • Ready-to-use from the Marketplace
    
    • Dynamically figure out API calls needed
    
    • Come with platform documentation built-in
    
    • Quick setup with no coding required
    
    • Best for automating work within specific tools
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Agents" icon="hammer">
    Custom agents you build from scratch for your unique business needs
    
    • Define capabilities with custom tools and prompts
    
    • Designed for any use case (research, support, analysis)
    
    • Requires configuration and setup
    
    • Maximum flexibility and control
    
    • Best for specialized workflows and business processes
  </Card>

## Key Features

</CardGroup>

## How They Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe what you want">
    Tell the assistant your goal in plain English—just like delegating to a colleague
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assistant figures it out">
    The AI determines what API calls to make and in what order
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Task completed">
    Your request is fulfilled and you receive confirmation with results
  </Step>
</Steps>

The assistant uses its understanding of the tool's API to dynamically construct the right sequence of actions. You don't need to know anything about APIs, authentication, or technical implementation.
