# AI Assistants

AI Assistants are intelligent agents that can complete complex, multi-step tasks in your favorite tools using simple, plain-English instructions. No technical knowledge or coding required.

## What are AI Assistants?

AI Assistants understand what you want to achieve and automatically figure out the steps needed to get it done. Just describe your task in natural language, and watch the assistant handle the technical details behind the scenes.

**Example:**
- **You say:** "Create a project tracker in Notion with tasks, owners, and due dates"
- **Assistant does:** Creates databases, sets up relationships, adds fields, and configures views—automatically

## How They Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe what you want">
    Tell the assistant your goal in plain English—just like delegating to a colleague
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assistant figures it out">
    The AI determines what API calls to make and in what order
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Task completed">
    Your request is fulfilled and you receive confirmation with results
  </Step>
</Steps>

The assistant uses its understanding of the tool's API to dynamically construct the right sequence of actions. You don't need to know anything about APIs, authentication, or technical implementation.

## What Makes These Different?

### 🧠 Self-Healing Intelligence
If something doesn't work on the first try, the assistant learns from the error and automatically tries a different approach. It gets smarter with every interaction.

### 🎯 Dynamic Task Planning
Unlike pre-built workflows, these assistants can handle tasks you've never set up before. They figure out what needs to be done on the fly.

### ⚡ Complex Workflows Made Simple
Tasks that would normally require multiple manual steps or custom tool-building happen automatically in seconds.

### 🔄 Continuous Learning (Select Assistants)
HubSpot and Salesforce assistants have **memory features** that remember successful approaches and get faster over time.
