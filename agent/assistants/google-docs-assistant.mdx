## What the Assistant Can't Do

Due to Google Docs API limitations, the assistant cannot:

- **Complex visual layouts**: Cannot create columns, text boxes, or advanced layouts
- **Comments and suggestions**: Cannot add comments or use suggestion mode
- **Version history**: Cannot access or restore previous versions
- **Sharing and permissions**: Cannot modify document sharing settings or permissions
- **Page setup**: Cannot change margins, page size, or orientation
- **Advanced formatting**: Limited support for styles, themes, and complex formatting

<Note>
The assistant excels at **content creation, text editing, and basic structure**. For complex visual design and formatting, you may need to use Google Docs directly after the assistant creates the initial document.
