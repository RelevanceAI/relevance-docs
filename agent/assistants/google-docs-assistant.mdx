## Built-in Helper Tools

Some Google Docs Assistants include specialized tools:

### HTML Formatting Tool

For complex formatting like tables, headers, and formatted lists:
- Converts your request to HTML
- Uploads via Google Drive API
- Creates properly formatted documents
- Handles tables with multiple columns
- Manages nested lists

**When to use:** If your assistant has this tool, you can request complex formatted content like:
- "Create a document with a 3-column table showing tasks, owners, and deadlines"
- "Make a document with headers, bullet points, and numbered sections"

<Note>
Not all Google Docs assistants have the HTML formatting tool. Check your assistant's tool list. If it doesn't have this tool, focus on simpler text-based operations.
</Note>

## Tips for Best Results

<Tip>
**Provide document names or IDs:**

Good: "Add text to the document called 'Project Notes'"

Better: "Add text to document 'Project Notes' (ID: 1abc...)" if you have the ID
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Be specific about placement:**

"Add at the end of the document..."
"Insert before the Conclusion section..."
"Replace the second paragraph..."
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Use clear section names:**

When referring to sections, use exact names:
"In the 'Executive Summary' section..." (not "in the summary part")
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Break complex formatting into steps:**

Instead of one massive request:
1. "Create the document with basic structure"
2. "Add the table to the Timeline section"
3. "Format the headings"
</Tip>

---

## What the Assistant Can't Do

Due to Google Docs API limitations, the assistant may have limitations with:

- Complex visual layouts (columns, text boxes, etc.)
- Images and embedded media (can add image URLs in some cases)
- Comments and suggestions mode
- Version history access
- Sharing and permission management
- Page setup (margins, page size, orientation)
- Styles and themes (limited formatting support)

<Note>
The assistant works best for **text content and basic structure**. For complex visual design, you'll need to use Google Docs directly.
</Note>

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Document not found"

**Cause:** Document name incorrect or you don't have access

**Solution:**
- First list your documents: "Show me all my Google Docs"
- Use the exact document name from the list
- Or provide the document ID from the URL

### "Permission denied"

**Cause:** OAuth connection doesn't have sufficient permissions

**Solution:**
1. Reconnect your Google account
2. Ensure you grant all requested permissions (Docs + Drive)
3. Check that you own or have edit access to the document

### Can't find recently created document

**Cause:** Document was created but not appearing in search

**Solution:**
- Wait a few seconds for Google's index to update
- Search by exact title used during creation
- Check your Google Drive directly
- Use the document ID provided in the creation response

### Formatting doesn't work as expected

**Cause:** API limitations or missing HTML formatting tool

**Solution:**
- If your assistant has HTML formatting tool, specify you want "formatted content"
- Otherwise, stick to basic text operations
- Apply complex formatting manually in Google Docs after creation

---

## Working with Document IDs

Google Docs can be referenced by name or ID:

**Document ID Location:**
The ID is in the URL:
```
https://docs.google.com/document/d/DOCUMENT_ID_HERE/edit
```

**When to use IDs:**
- When you have multiple documents with similar names
- For more reliable document targeting
- When working with documents programmatically

**Example:**
```
"Add content to document ID 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j"
```

---

## Document Sharing & Permissions

The assistant can work with documents you own or have edit access to:

**What you can do:**
- Create new documents (always owned by you)
- Edit documents you own
- Edit shared documents where you have edit permission

**What you can't do:**
- Edit documents where you only have view/comment access
- Access documents not shared with your Google account
- Modify sharing settings programmatically

---

## Pricing & Credits

The Google Docs Assistant uses credits based on:
- Task complexity
- Document size
- Number of operations

**Typical credit costs:**
- Simple tasks (create blank doc, add text): ~10-30 credits
- Medium tasks (structured documents): ~30-80 credits
- Complex tasks (formatted documents with tables): ~80-150 credits

<Tip>
Document operations are generally efficient. Even creating complex formatted documents typically costs less than 200 credits.
</Tip>

---

## Google Drive Integration

Google Docs Assistant works in conjunction with Google Drive:

**Folder Operations:**
While the Docs Assistant focuses on document content, document organization (folders, sharing) is typically handled by a Google Drive Assistant.

**Finding Documents:**
Documents are stored in your Google Drive. You can reference them by:
- Document name (searches your Drive)
- Document ID (direct access)
- Folder location (if using Drive Assistant)

---

## Best Practices

**Document Naming:**
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Include dates for recurring documents
- Use consistent naming conventions

**Template Strategy:**
- Create master templates once
- Copy templates for new instances
- Don't modify the master template directly

**Content Organization:**
- Create documents with clear sections
- Use consistent heading styles
- Keep structure simple for easier updates

**Batch Operations:**
- Create multiple similar documents in one request
- Use consistent structure across batch
- Verify one document before creating many
