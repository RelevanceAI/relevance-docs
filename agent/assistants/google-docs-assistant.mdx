## How It Works

The Google Docs Assistant does all the heavy lifting in the background—you just describe what you need in plain English, and it handles the rest.

**Automatic Research & Execution**
- Reviews Google Docs API documentation automatically before taking action
- Figures out the right sequence of API calls without you needing to know anything technical
- Retries failed operations up to 3 times with adjustments (you won't even notice)
- Verifies results after each operation

**Finds Documents For You**
- Automatically searches for documents by name—no need to hunt for IDs
- Only asks for document IDs if it can't locate files on its own
- Includes clickable document/folder links in responses

**Built-In Safety**
- Always asks for confirmation before deleting or making irreversible changes
- Asks every time to keep your documents safe, even if you previously gave permission
- Sets image width to 600px by default to prevent overflow

## What the Assistant Can't Do

Due to Google Docs API limitations, the assistant cannot:

- **Complex visual layouts**: Cannot create columns, text boxes, or advanced layouts
- **Comments and suggestions**: Cannot add comments or use suggestion mode
- **Version history**: Cannot access or restore previous versions
- **Sharing and permissions**: Cannot modify document sharing settings or permissions
- **Page setup**: Cannot change margins, page size, or orientation
- **Advanced formatting**: Limited support for styles, themes, and complex formatting

<Note>
The assistant excels at **content creation, text editing, and basic structure**. For complex visual design and formatting, you may need to use Google Docs directly after the assistant creates the initial document.
</Note>
