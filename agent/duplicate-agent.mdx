## Overview

Want to create a similar agent with slight modifications? Relevance AI offers two methods to duplicate your agents, whether you need a quick copy for testing or want to create variations for different use cases.

## Method 1: Copy to Project (Recommended)

The quickest way to duplicate an agent is using the **"Copy to Project"** feature. This method creates a complete copy of your agent in just a few clicks.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your Agents list">
    Go to your Agents page in the Relevance AI platform
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the agent you want to duplicate">
    Locate the agent you want to copy in your agents list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the agent menu">
    Click the three-dot menu (⋮) next to the agent name
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Copy to Project">
    Choose "Copy to Project" from the dropdown menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose destination">
    Select the destination project (can be the same project or a different one)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete the copy">
    Click "Copy" to create your duplicate agent
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What gets copied?

When you use Copy to Project, the following elements are preserved:

  <Card title="Agent Configuration" icon="gear">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Privacy Settings" icon="lock">
    Your agent's privacy and access settings are preserved
  </Card>
  <Card title="Variables" icon="code">
    Custom variables and their default values are included

</CardGroup>

## Method 2: Clonable Template

You can also create a clonable template link and use it yourself to duplicate an agent. This method is particularly useful when you want to share the agent with others AND keep copies for yourself.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your agent">
    Navigate to the agent you want to duplicate
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access the Share menu">
    Click the "Run" button, then click "Share"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable clonable template">
    Toggle on "Create a clonable template"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable public access">
    Click "Enable public access" to generate the clone link
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the link">
    Copy the clone link provided
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the link to clone">
    Open the link in your browser to create a copy of your agent
  </Step>
</Steps>

### When to use Clonable Templates

This method is ideal when you want to:

- **Share with others**: Distribute your agent to team members or external users
- **Create multiple copies**: Generate several variations from the same template
- **Cross-workspace sharing**: Share agents across different workspaces or organizations
- **Template distribution**: Create a reusable template that can be cloned multiple times

<Tip>
You can use the clone link yourself to create copies of your own agents. This is useful for creating variations or backups without affecting the original.
</Tip>

## What Happens After Duplication?

After duplicating an agent using either method:

- The **new agent is independent** from the original
- Changes to the duplicate **don't affect** the original agent
- Changes to the original **don't affect** the duplicate
- Both agents can be modified, deleted, or shared separately
- Each agent uses its own credits and resources

<Warning>
**Integration credentials are not copied.** If your agent uses integrations (like Gmail, Slack, or Google Sheets), you'll need to reconnect them in the duplicated agent.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I don't see the 'Copy to Project' option">
    Make sure you're viewing the agents list (not inside an agent). The three-dot menu with "Copy to Project" appears next to each agent in the list view. If you still don't see it, try refreshing your browser or contact support.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="My integrations aren't working in the duplicated agent">
    Integration credentials are not copied for security reasons. You'll need to reconnect any integrations (Gmail, Slack, etc.) in your duplicated agent's settings.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I duplicate an agent from the Marketplace?">
    Yes! Marketplace agents are designed to be cloned. Click "Clone" on any marketplace agent to add it to your workspace, then you can duplicate it further using either method described above.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The clonable template link isn't working">
    Ensure that "Enable public access" is toggled on in the Share settings. If the link still doesn't work, try generating a new clone link or use the Copy to Project method instead.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
