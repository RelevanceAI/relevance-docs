## Option 1: Invent an Agent

The fastest way to get started. Describe what you need and we'll generate a working Agent for you.

![Select Invent to describe what you want and let AI build your Agent.](/images/quickstart-invent-agent.png)

1. Click **Agents** in the left sidebar
2. Click **+ Create Agent**
3. Select **Invent**
4. Describe what you want your Agent to do — be specific about the task, the output you expect, and any integrations it should use. For example: *"Create an agent that researches a company before a sales call. It should use web search to find recent news, funding, and key contacts, then output a one-page brief with company overview, decision makers, and talking points."*
5. Review the generated Agent — Inventor will set up the prompt and suggest Tools
6. Connect any integrations your Tools need (e.g. Gmail, HubSpot, LinkedIn) in the Tools section of the Agent builder, or [add integrations](/integrations/add-integrations) from the sidebar

<Tip>
Best when you know what you want and can describe it clearly. Great for getting a concept off the ground quickly — Inventor handles the setup, you make the tweaks.
</Tip>

## Option 2: Clone from Marketplace

Start with an Agent that's already been built and tested by domain experts.

![Browse the Marketplace to find pre-built Agents for common use cases.](/images/create-agent-marketplace.png)

1. Go to [Marketplace](https://marketplace.relevanceai.com/) or click **Marketplace** in the left sidebar
2. Browse or search for an Agent that matches your use case
3. Click on the Agent to view its details
4. Click **Clone** to add it to your workspace
5. A setup popup will walk you through connecting any integrations the Agent needs — follow the prompts to link your accounts
6. Review the prompt, Tools, and settings — adjust anything you need

<Tip>
Great when you have a common use case — like lead qualification, meeting prep, or customer support — and want a proven starting point. Clone it, tweak it, ship it.
</Tip>

## Option 3: Build from scratch

Full control from the ground up. Best if you have a specific workflow in mind.

![The Agent builder — configure your prompt, Tools, and Knowledge from scratch.](/images/build-platform-overview.png)

1. Click **Agents** in the left sidebar
2. Click **+ Create Agent**
3. Select **Start from scratch**
4. Write a [prompt](/agent/build-your-agent/prompt) — tell the Agent who it is, what it does, and how it should behave
5. Add [Tools](/agent/build-your-agent/tools) — give it the actions it needs (search the web, send emails, update your CRM, etc.)
6. Optionally add [Knowledge](/knowledge/create-knowledge) — upload docs or connect data sources for context

## What's next?

Once you've created an Agent, explore the rest of the build guides to refine it:

- [Prompt](/agent/build-your-agent/prompt) — write instructions that define your Agent's behavior
- [Tools](/agent/build-your-agent/tools) — give your Agent the actions it needs
- [Triggers](/agent/build-your-agent/triggers) — run your Agent automatically on a schedule, from a webhook, or from an integration
- [Escalations](/agent/build-your-agent/escalations) — define when your Agent should loop in a human
- [Memory](/agent/build-your-agent/memory) — configure how your Agent retains context across conversations
