Navigate to the “Share” button in the top right of the agent chat interface.

Relevance AI offers two options for sharing your agents to enable collaboration and wider usage.

1. **Allow others to clone as template:** Toggle this on to let others create their own version of your agent. Users can clone the agent into their own projects.
2. **Allow sharing & embedding of your agent:** Create a shareable and embeddable version of your agent. This allows others to use your agent directly, with usage charged to your Relevance account. It's ideal for adding agents to websites, applications, or shared workspaces.
