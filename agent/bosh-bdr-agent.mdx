## Bosh helps you focus on the best converting channels

The best converting sales channels are face-to-face demos and calls. However all of the inbound activity that a sales team has to do usually takes away from these channels.

You can flip this by getting Bosh to handle all of the time-consuming inbound tasks like researching prospects, filtering the highest value leads and handling all of the back-and-forth email communications for you. This will free up your sales team to handle the highest converting channels: Human interaction.


## Bosh is more like an AI Employee

Bosh is not another piece of sales software that you add to your tech stack. Rather, Bosh is more like an employee that sits in a seat at your company, follows your processes and uses your tech stack much like a human would. Except, they are infinitely scalable.

## Bosh is a multi-agent team

Bosh is not actually a single agent, but a multi-agent system.

- **Lead Qualifier**: You can create nuanced and custom lead qualification criteria that matches those you follow in your company processes. E.g. Filter out prospects who are unlikely to be non-decision makers.
- **Prospect Researcher:** Researches the prospect and decides how low or high-value they are based on your own criteria. Research also involves pulling in recent events related to the prospect for more personalised outreach.
- **Sales Strategiser:** Forms a strategy around how to reach out to the prospect based on research conducted by the Prospect Researcher. They can generate a value hypothesis to describe the kind of value your company can create for your prospect's company.
- **Inbox Manager**: Receive and send emails. They can write highly personalised emails based on the research and sales strategy work. This would usually take a person at least 30 minutes to do manually.
- **Follow-up Manager**: If your prospect responds right away, your agent will reply within 15 minutes. If they don't know the answer, they will escalate to a human who will provide the answer. Then they will rephrase it to match the tone and respond. They'll also save that answer for future responses to similar questions.
- **Calendar Scheduler:** Knows which Account Executive (AE) is responsible for which prospect, and can go into that AE's calendar and try to find a time that the AE can speak to the prospect in their time zone.
... and more!

All of these agents work together as a team. They can delegate tasks to each other so that they can get their job done quickly and more robustly than one agent alone could.

### Frequently Asked Questions about Bosh the BDR agent

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does Bosh scale?">
    Let's say you start out by asking Bosh to handle 100 prospects. You love how it's working and your team now has the capacity to deal with more meetings (because Bosh handles the top-of-funnel work now). You decide you want Bosh to handle 2000 accounts now.
    
    All you need to do is give Bosh the list of new accounts. That's it. That's all you need to scale.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many meetings will Bosh book for you?">
    It depends on your business. If you have a process that you are using right now that is working and is providing you a certain output or conversion rate. Bosh will take that process and do it at scale.
    
    If you have SDRs that are doing research, writing emails, manually personalising them, then we can scale that up so your people don't have to do that anymore.
    
    The input that Bosh receives is the number of prospects that you want to contact. Let's say you start of with 50,000 prospects for the year. Bosh will handle all of these 50,000 prospects. That is usually something that will take 8 people to do in a year. Bosh will book a similar amount of meetings as all of those people put together.
    
    This frees up your people to focus on the more interesting work at the bottom of the funnel, closing deals!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What triggers Bosh to start working?">
    It's entirely up to you what trigger you setup to get Bosh to start working. For inbound cases, you can give it an instruction to reach out to particular people in your CRM tool of choice. Many of our customers who use Salesforce just create a Boolean field so that when its checked, the agent knows to start working on that person.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can Bosh find new contacts?">
    Bosh can find more contacts that what is in your database or CRM. You can equip Bosh with a prospecting agent, which can use a feature like ZoomInfo for Appollo to find new leads. You can define your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and describe your target audience. The prospecting agent will then go and find leads that match your criteria, and hand those leads over to Bosh to handle if you want to.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How quickly does Bosh respond?">
    If a prospect replies to your cold outreach asking you to tell them more, and you don't get back to them in half an hour, your chance of converting them goes down by the minute. Salespeople are usually do busy to respond that quickly, so they might respond out of hours or over a weekend or on a public holiday. All of which lowers the likelihood of your prospect converting. Bosh responds within 15m.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does Bosh know who to escalate to?">
    You can decide who Bosh escalates to. You can get it to escalate to a single person, or you can send it to a Slack channel or other team tool that has many people across all timezones.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How customisable is Bosh?">
    There isn't a single thing in our agents that you cannot change. You can setup agents so that they follow your standard operating procedures.
    
    We're not just a piece of software that is made up of prompts and code that only our team at Relevance AI can edit. You can personally edit and touch these things. During our implementation process, if you have anything that you really like that already work well for you, we can connect those things to agents as tools.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do emails sent by Bosh go to spam?">
    You typically only have to worry about this if you are sending high volumes of generic, templated emails. Bosh Agent acts more like a person, meaning that a few aspects of its behaviour protect it from harming deliverability:
    
    1. Emails are personalised rather than generic, so email servers don’t see it as mass-email spam.
    2. Recipients are less likely to mark it as spam because it contains information unique to them and their company, due to the research and personalisation.
    3. Volumes of emails are ramped up over time, similar to what a person would generate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does onboarding Bosh look like?">
    There is a lot that goes into onboarding Bosh. This isn't a piece of software that you're taking off the shelf and configuring in the same hour. Bosh is more like onboarding an employee, which takes time and expertise from our success team.
    
    When we onboard Bosh, it takes a couple of weeks of configuration. Once it's configured, we launch it into approval mode and then into full autopilot mode after a couple of weeks after we have fully customised it to your company's needs.
    
    Our customer success team are senior staff members who do this for enterprise customers full-time, and are fully backed up by our in-house software and AI engineers respectively.
    
    Your agent will have a probation period, so you can fire them within 3 months if it's not working out.

    During the onboarding process, we try to upskill the people on your team so that they can onboard agents too. But our goal is for you to see success, whether that's through our team doing all of the heavy lifting or not.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will prospects know that they are talking to an AI Agent?">
    Our customers usually create a persona for each agent, with a name and a personality. The quality of the communication is so personalised that it is unlikely that your prospects will realise that it is an AI Agent.
    
    However, if a prospect asks the agent if they are AI, we don't recommend that you say it isn't. When a prospect does ask this question (it hasn't happened yet for our enterprise customers), it immediately gets escalated to a human to respond to. 
    
    In this scenario, we recommend introducing your Agent team-member and explaining what they do, and where you are involved in the process (e.g. You answer questions the agent doesn't know, they can ask to speak to a human at any time, etc).
    
    It is entirely up to you how you handle this.
