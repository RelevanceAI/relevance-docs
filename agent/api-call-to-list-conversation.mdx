This page explains all the required steps to successfully make an API call to collect the conversations with an agent.

## Relevance Keys
<Snippet file="relevance-keys.mdx" />

## Agent Id
<Snippet file="agent-id.mdx" />

## Conversation Id
### From URL
<Snippet file="conversation-id.mdx" />

### API call to list all conversation Ids
Relevance stores agent conversations in knowledge. 
To list all conversations with your Agent, provide the corresponding values for `Region`, `Agent Id` and `Authorization token` in the
code snippet below.

    ```Python
    authorization_token = f"{project_id}:{api_key}"   # Both values can be found in the API Keys page
    region = Region       # Can be found in the API Keys page
    agent_id = Agent_id   # Can be found in the Agent page URL

    ```

<Tip>
**The endpoint to list all conversation Ids**:

`https://api-{Region}.stack.tryrelevance.com/latest/knowledge/sets/list`

\<Region\> can be found at [API keys](/get-started/key-concepts/api-keys).
</Tip>

```Python
url = f"https://api-{region}.stack.tryrelevance.com/latest/knowledge/sets/list"
filters = [
            {
              "filter_type": "exact_match",
              "field": "type",
              "condition_value": "conversation",
            },
            {
                "filter_type": "exact_match",
                "field": "conversation.agent_id",
                "condition_value": agent_id
            }
]

headers = {
      "Authorization": authorization_token
  }

payload = {"filters":filters, "include_hidden":True}

payload_json = json.dumps(payload)

# Send the POST request
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=payload_json)

response.json()["results"]
```

The output is a list of dictionaries. All conversation Ids associated with the target agent can be found under the `knowledge_set` field.
In the sample below, `041157d4-61bb-4855-8202-cdf8fab7202a` is a conversation that can be used in the next step.

`'knowledge_set': '041157d4-61bb-4855-8202-cdf8fab7202a'`

## API call to list all conversations using the conversation Id(s)

To list all conversations with your Agent, provide the corresponding values for `Region`, `Conversation Id` and `Authorization token` in the
code snippet below. The output is a list of all conversations registered between the Agent and the user under the provided conversation Id.

    ```Python
    authorization_token = f"{project_id}:{api_key}"   # Both values can be found in the API Keys page
    region = Region                                   # Can be found in the API Keys page
    conversation_id = Conversation_Id                 # From the previous step

    ```

**The endpoint to list all conversations with an agent**:

\<Region\> can be found at [API keys](/get-started/key-concepts/api-keys).

```Python
url = f"https://api-{region}.stack.tryrelevance.com/latest/knowledge/list"

headers = {"Authorization": authorization_token}

payload = {
    "knowledge_set": conversation_id,
    "filters":[]
    }
payload_json = json.dumps(payload)

# Send the POST request
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=payload_json)

Conversations = response.json()["results"]
```
