### API call to list all conversation Ids
Relevance stores agent conversations in knowledge. 
To list all conversations with your Agent, provide the corresponding values for `Region`, `Agent Id` and `Authorization token` in the
code snippet below.

```Python
url = f"https://api-{Region}.stack.tryrelevance.com/latest/knowledge/sets/list"
filters = [
            {
              "filter_type": "exact_match",
              "field": "type",
              "condition_value": "conversation",
            },
            {
                "filter_type": "exact_match",
                "field": "conversation.agent_id",
                "condition_value": "Agent Id"
            }
]

headers = {
      "Authorization": "Authorization token"
  }

payload = {"filters":filters, "include_hidden":True}

payload_json = json.dumps(payload)

# Send the POST request
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=payload_json)

response.json()["results"]
```

The output is a list of dictionaries. All conversation Ids associated with the target agent can be found under the `knowledge_set` field.
In the sample below, `041157d4-61bb-4855-8202-cdf8fab7202a` a conversation than can be used in the next step.

`'knowledge_set': '041157d4-61bb-4855-8202-cdf8fab7202a'`

## API call to list all conversations using the conversation Id(s)

To list all conversations with your Agent, provide the corresponding values for `Region`, `Conversation Id` and `Authorization token` in the
code snippet below. The output is a list of all conversations registered between the Agent and the user under the provided conversation Id.

```Python
url = f"https://api-{Region}.stack.tryrelevance.com/latest/knowledge/list"

headers = {"Authorization": Authorization token}

payload = {
    "knowledge_set": "Conversation Id",
    "filters":[]
    }
payload_json = json.dumps(payload)

# Send the POST request
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=payload_json)

Conversations = response.json()["results"]
```
