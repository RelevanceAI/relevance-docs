## What are Agent Templates?

Agent templates are pre-built agent team-members that you can use out-of-the box to get specific jobs done. We encourage you to use these as a launch pad to build agents that are more custom and tailored to your own company goals. They're a great place to try out agents and get an idea for what they're capable of.
