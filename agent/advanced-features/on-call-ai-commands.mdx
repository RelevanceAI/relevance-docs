On-Call AI Commands let meeting participants control your agent by typing keywords in the meeting chat. The agent responds immediately: pausing recording, performing searches, or sending messages.

## Example Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `Monty pause` | Stop recording for sensitive discussions |
| `Monty resume` | Restart recording |
| `Monty search [query]` | Get instant research during the call |
| `Monty note: [text]` | Flag important items |

<Note>
**"Monty" is the trigger word in the demo.** Configure any trigger word you want.
</Note>

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Interaction Webhooks">
    1. Open your Meeting Notetaker Agent → **Tools**
    2. Edit the **"Send Meeting Bot"** tool
    3. Go to **Advanced** tab → **Interaction Webhooks**
    4. Toggle ON and enter your trigger word (e.g., "Monty")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Required Tools">
    Add these four tools to your agent:
    
    1. **Resume Recording**
    2. **Pause Recording**
    3. **Google Search**
    4. **Send Meeting Bot Message**
    
    <Warning>
    Google Search must ALWAYS be followed by "Send Meeting Bot Message" to display results in chat.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Prompt">
    Add to your agent prompt:
    
    ```
    You have four tools:
    - Resume Recording
    - Pause Recording
    - Google Search (Always use "Send Meeting Bot Message" after it)
    - Send Meeting Bot Message (Required after Google Search to show results)
    
    Use them when requested.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test">
    1. Have your agent join a test meeting
    2. Type: `Monty search test query`
    3. Verify response appears in chat
    4. Test pause/resume commands
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Commands

### Recording Control

```
Monty pause recording  → Recording paused
Monty resume recording → Recording resumed
```

Use for sensitive discussions that shouldn't be recorded.

### Live Search

```
Monty search SOC 2 compliance requirements
```

Returns search results directly in the meeting chat.

### Notes

```
Monty note: Follow up with legal by Friday
```

Adds to priority action items in the meeting summary.

## Extending Functionality

Add more tools for advanced use cases:

| Integration | Command Example |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Notion** | `Monty save to notion: New feature idea` |
| **Slack** | `Monty notify #engineering about this` |
| **APIs** | `Monty what's the AAPL stock price` |

## Best Practices

- **Choose distinctive trigger words** - Avoid common words like "um" or "okay"
- **Announce availability** - Tell participants commands are available at meeting start
- **Confirm actions** - Agent should acknowledge commands in chat

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Agent not responding | Verify Interaction Webhooks is ON, check trigger word spelling |
| Search results not appearing | Ensure prompt includes "use Send Meeting Bot Message after Google Search" |
| Recording controls not working | Wait 2-3 seconds between pause/resume commands |
