## Overview

Interaction Webhooks enable your agents to respond to commands in real-time during live meetings. When participants mention trigger words in the meeting chat, your agent can immediately take action—pausing recording, performing searches, sending messages, or executing any tool in its toolkit.

This powerful feature transforms your Meeting Notetaker from a passive recorder into an active meeting participant that responds to your needs in real-time.

## What Are Realtime "On Call" Commands?

Realtime "On Call" Commands allow meeting participants to interact with your agent during live meetings by typing trigger words in the meeting chat. The agent listens for these keywords and responds immediately with configured actions.

### Example Scenarios

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Pause Recording" icon="pause">
    Type "@notetaker pause" to stop recording during sensitive discussions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Live Search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Type "@notetaker search competitor pricing" to get instant research
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create Action Items" icon="list-check">
    Type "@notetaker note: Follow up with legal" to add priority items
  </Card>
  <Card title="Share Resources" icon="share">
    Type "@notetaker send product roadmap" to share links with participants
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trigger Word Detection">
    Your agent monitors the meeting chat for configured trigger words (e.g., "@notetaker", "hey bot")
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Command Parsing">
    When a trigger word is detected, the agent parses the command to understand the requested action
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Action Execution">
    The agent executes the appropriate action using its available tools (search, pause/resume, send message, etc.)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Response Delivery">
    The agent responds in the meeting chat or takes the requested action immediately
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up Interaction Webhooks

### Prerequisites

- A Meeting Notetaker Agent with RecallAI integration
- Access to Advanced Settings in your agent configuration

### Configuration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Advanced Settings">
    1. Open your Meeting Notetaker Agent
    2. Go to **Advanced Settings** in the agent configuration
    3. Find the **Interaction Webhooks** section
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable Webhooks">
    1. Toggle **Enable Interaction Webhooks** to ON
    2. This activates real-time command listening during meetings
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Trigger Words">
    Set up the keywords that will activate your agent:
    
    ```json
    {
      "trigger_words": [
        "@notetaker",
        "hey bot",
        "assistant"
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    <Tip>
    Use distinctive trigger words that won't be accidentally mentioned in normal conversation.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Actions">
    Configure what actions are available and how they're triggered:
    
    ```json
    {
      "actions": {
        "pause": {
          "keywords": ["pause", "stop recording"],
          "tool": "pause_recording",
          "confirmation": "Recording paused"
        },
        "resume": {
          "keywords": ["resume", "start recording"],
          "tool": "resume_recording",
          "confirmation": "Recording resumed"
        },
        "search": {
          "keywords": ["search", "look up", "find"],
          "tool": "google_search",
          "response_format": "chat_message"
        },
        "note": {
          "keywords": ["note", "remember", "action item"],
          "tool": "add_priority_note",
          "response_format": "confirmation"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Your Setup">
    1. Create a test meeting
    2. Have your agent join
    3. Try trigger words in the chat
    4. Verify the agent responds correctly
  </Step>
</Steps>

Create sophisticated command patterns with variables:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "pattern": "@notetaker search {query}",
      "action": "google_search",
      "parameters": {
        "query": "{query}",
        "num_results": 5
      }
    },
    {
      "pattern": "@notetaker remind {person} about {topic}",
      "action": "send_reminder",
      "parameters": {
        "recipient": "{person}",
        "subject": "{topic}",
        "context": "meeting_transcript"
      }
    },

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Conditional Actions

Execute actions based on meeting context:

```json
{
  "conditional_actions": {
    "customer_meeting": {
      "auto_log_to_crm": true,
      "notify_account_team": true,
      "priority_notes": "high"
    },
    "internal_meeting": {
      "auto_log_to_crm": false,

      "priority_notes": "normal"
    }
  }
}
```

### Response Templates

Customize how your agent responds:

```json
{
  "response_templates": {
    "pause_confirmation": "✅ Recording paused. Type '@notetaker resume' to continue.",
    "search_intro": "🔍 Searching for: {query}...",
    "search_results": "Here's what I found:\n{results}",
    "action_item_added": "✓ Added to action items: {content}",
    "error": "❌ Sorry, I couldn't complete that action. Please try again."
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose Clear Trigger Words" icon="bullseye">
    Select trigger words that are:
    - **Distinctive**: Won't be mentioned accidentally
    - **Easy to remember**: Simple for participants to use
    - **Professional**: Appropriate for business meetings
    
    ✅ Good: "@notetaker", "@assistant", "hey bot"
    ❌ Avoid: "um", "okay", "yes" (too common)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provide Command Help" icon="circle-question">
    Make commands discoverable:
    - Have agent announce available commands when joining
    - Respond to "@notetaker help" with command list

    - Include next steps when relevant
    
    This ensures participants know their commands were received and processed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Handle Errors Gracefully" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    When commands fail:
    - Provide clear error messages
    - Suggest alternatives
    - Offer to escalate to human if needed
    
    **Example**: "I couldn't find that document. Did you mean 'product roadmap Q1'?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Respect Privacy" icon="user-shield">
    For recording control commands:
    - Respond immediately to pause requests
    - Confirm when recording resumes

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
**Important**: Interaction Webhooks execute actions in real-time during meetings. Ensure proper access controls and validation.
</Warning>

### Access Control

- **Authenticate Commands**: Verify commands come from authorized participants
- **Limit Actions**: Restrict sensitive actions to specific users
- **Audit Logging**: Log all commands and actions for compliance
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent command spam or abuse

### Data Privacy

- **Sensitive Information**: Be cautious with commands that expose data
- **Recording Control**: Always honor pause/resume requests immediately
- **Consent**: Ensure all participants consent to interactive agent features
- **Compliance**: Follow data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
