<Warning>
**Team plan or above required**: Bulk scheduling is only available to users on the Team plan or above.
</Warning>

Bulk Scheduling allows you to automate large-scale task execution for your agent by processing data from Excel files or knowledge tables. Instead of manually creating individual tasks, you can import a spreadsheet or knowledge table where each row becomes a separate task that your agent will process automatically.

This feature is ideal for scenarios where you need to:
- Process many similar tasks automatically
- Personalize agent interactions using data from spreadsheets
- Schedule tasks to run during specific working hours
- Distribute task execution over time to manage workload

With bulk scheduling, you can set up message templates that dynamically pull data from your source files, configure working hours to align with your team's schedule, and control how tasks are distributed over time.

## How to set up bulk scheduling

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>

</div>

To create a bulk schedule for your agent:

1. Navigate to the agent builder and click on the `Run` tab.
2. Look for the dropdown menu next to the `+ New Task` button and select `Schedule in bulk`.
3. Select a spreadsheet or knowledge table that contains the data you want your agent to process.
4. Enter a message template for your agent to use. This message will be sent to your agent for every single task run automatically. You can reference variables from your data using double curly braces (e.g., **\{\{variable_name}}**). Read more about how to create message templates [below](#using-the-agent-message-template).
5. Configure working hours for the batch schedule to ensure that tasks are being run at the appropriate time.
6. Click `Schedule` to create your bulk schedule.

<Note>
We recommend using descriptive column names in your spreadsheet or knowledge table, and testing with a small dataset first before scheduling large batches of tasks.

## Using the agent message template

The message template you create will be sent to your agent automatically for every single task run. This allows you to personalize each task with data from your spreadsheet or knowledge table.

For example, if you want each task to reference a different email address or name, you can use variables in your message template. Variables are referenced using double curly braces with the column name from your data source: **\{\{column_name}}**.

**How it works:**

- Each row in your spreadsheet or knowledge table becomes a separate task
- The message template is sent to your agent for each task
- Variables in double curly braces (like **\{\{email}}** or **\{\{name}}**) are replaced with the actual values from that row
- You can use any column from your selected data source as a variable

**Example:**

If your spreadsheet has columns for "company" and "email", you could create a template like:

"Please research **\{\{company}}** and send the findings to **\{\{email}}**."

When the tasks run, each one will automatically use the specific company and email from that row's data.

## Using the working hours

A key feature of bulk scheduling is the ability to queue working hours, which allows you to fine-tune how and when tasks are distributed. This ensures that your automated workflows align perfectly with your team's schedule and work patterns.

**Key components:**

- Timezone: Select your preferred timezone to ensure tasks are scheduled according to your local time, for example: Australia - Sydney.

- Work Days: Specify which days of the week tasks should be scheduled.

- Work Hours: Set the time range during which tasks should be executed. You also have the option to select "All day" for 24/7 task execution.

- Task Distribution: Define the number of tasks to be sent per interval. For example, set a specific number of tasks per day. The actual number of tasks your agent can execute may vary due to factors like conflicting contract conditions and rate limiting.

- Override Mode: This give you the option to run all created tasks in override mode, which can be useful for testing or when you need to maintain specific inputs/outputs across all tasks.

<Note>
We recommend aligning your work days and hours with your team's actual working schedule to ensure timely handling of task outputs. Also, start with a conservative number of tasks per interval and gradually increase as you assess your team's capacity and the agent's performance.

## Monitoring your bulk schedule

To view and manage your bulk schedule, navigate to the agent builder, click on the `Run` tab, and then click on `Agent queue` in the top left on the sidebar. From there, you can click on the CSV or knowledge table that you just chose to see your tasks organized by status:

- **Upcoming**: Tasks that are scheduled but haven't started yet
- **In progress**: Tasks that are currently being processed
- **Failed**: Tasks that encountered errors during execution
- **Processed**: Tasks that have completed successfully
- **Cancelled**: Tasks that have been cancelled

Note that you can't cancel specific tasks individually. You can only cancel all tasks within the upcoming view.
