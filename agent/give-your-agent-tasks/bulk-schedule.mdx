## How to access bulk scheduling

1. Navigate to your agent's interface.
2. Click on the `Run` tab.
3. Look for the dropdown menu next to the `+ New Task` button.
4. Select `Schedule in bulk` from the options.

## Setting up a batch schedule

When setting up a batch schedule, you'll need to:
1. Select a spreadsheet or knowledge table that contains the data you want your agent to process.
2. Enter a message template for your agent to use. This should include your data's column names, which are automatically added as variables accessible using double curly braces: **\{\{variable_name}}**.
3. Queue working hours for the batch schedule as desired to ensure that tasks are being run at the appropriate time.


## Using the agent message template

The Agent Message template is where you define how your agent should interact with each entry in your knowledge table. This is done using a templating system that allows you to dynamically insert values from your table into the agent's instructions.

**Key points:**

- Double Brace Syntax: to insert values from your table, use double braces around the column name.

- Column Names: you can use any column from your selected knowledge table.

- Example Usage: if you have a column named "company" in your table, you could create a template like this: "Please analyze the performance of **\{\{company\}\}** based on the provided data."

## Using the working hours

A key feature of bulk scheduling is the ability to queue working hours, which allows you to fine-tune how and when tasks are distributed. This ensures that your automated workflows align perfectly with your team's schedule and work patterns.

**Key components:**

- Timezone: Select your preferred timezone to ensure tasks are scheduled according to your local time, for example: Australia - Sydney.

- Work Days: Specify which days of the week tasks should be scheduled.

- Work Hours: Set the time range during which tasks should be executed. You also have the option to select "All day" for 24/7 task execution.

- Task Distribution: Define the number of tasks to be sent per interval. For example, set a specific number of tasks per day. The actual number of tasks your agent can execute may vary due to factors like conflicting contract conditions and rate limiting.

- Override Mode: This give you the option to run all created tasks in override mode, which can be useful for testing or when you need to maintain specific inputs/outputs across all tasks.

### Best practices for working hours

- Align with team availability: Set work days and hours that match your team's actual working schedule to ensure timely handling of task outputs.

- Consider task complexity: Adjust the number of tasks per interval based on the complexity of each task and your team's capacity.

- Start conservative: Begin with a lower number of tasks per interval and gradually increase as you assess your team's capacity and the agent's performance.


**In summary**

Once you've configured the desired working hours, hit `Schedule`.

You can check the statuses of bulk schedules you have set up by navigating to the `Run` tab in the agent builder and clicking `Agent queue` in the task list view on the left.
