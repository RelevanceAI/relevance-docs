## What are Recurring Schedules?

Recurring Schedules let your AI agents run automatically at set times without you having to start them manually. Think of it like setting up automatic bill payments - once configured, everything happens on schedule without your intervention.

## Why Use Recurring Schedules?

- **Save time** by automating repetitive tasks
- **Never miss important processes** - they run even if you forget
- **Maintain consistency** in your workflows
- **Keep things running** outside business hours

## Setting Up Your First Recurring Schedule

Setting up is simple:

1. Go to your agent in the Relevance AI dashboard
2. Click 'Edit Agent'
3. Select 'Recurring Schedule'
4. Choose how often you want your agent to run:

| Schedule Type | What It Does | Perfect For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Daily** | Runs every day at a time you choose | Morning reports, daily check-ins |
| **Weekly** | Runs on specific days each week | Team updates, weekly newsletters |
| **Monthly** | Runs on chosen dates each month | Monthly reports, regular maintenance |
| **Custom** | Runs on specific dates you select | One-off tasks or irregular schedules |

## Real-World Examples

### For Marketing Teams

Set your agent to gather social media metrics every Monday morning and prepare a weekly performance report.

### For Sales Teams

Schedule daily updates on new leads and automatic follow-up messages to prospects who haven't responded in 3 days.

### For Operations

Create monthly inventory reports that run automatically on the 1st of each month.

## Pro Tips

- **Start small**: Begin with one simple recurring task before setting up complex schedules
- **Test thoroughly**: Run your agent manually first to ensure it works as expected
- **Monitor initially**: Check the first few automated runs to confirm everything works correctly
- **Layer schedules**: For complex workflows, use multiple agents with different schedules that work together

## Troubleshooting

**Q: What if my agent encounters an error during a scheduled run?**

A: The system logs errors and can send notifications based on your settings.

**Q: Can I temporarily pause a recurring schedule?**

A: Yes, you can disable schedules without deleting them when you need a pause.

**Q: How do I change an existing schedule?**

A: Simply go back to the Recurring Schedule section in your agent settings and update as needed.
