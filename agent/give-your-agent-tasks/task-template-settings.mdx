## Task Templates: Temporary Adjustments for Specific Situations

Need your AI agent to behave differently for just one task? Task templates let you make temporary changes to your agent's settings without permanently altering its core configuration.

### What Are Task Templates?

Task templates are like quick costume changes for your AI agent. They allow you to:

- Temporarily modify how your agent behaves for a single interaction
- Apply special settings for specific situations
- Return automatically to normal settings once the task is complete

Think of it as giving your agent a temporary personality shift for a particular job, without changing who they fundamentally are.

### When to Use Task Templates

**Perfect for when you need your agent to:**

- Use a different tone (formal instead of casual)
- Focus on specific knowledge areas
- Follow a different conversation approach
- Test new configurations without commitment

### Key Benefits

### Experiment Without Commitment
Try different settings without permanently changing your agent's configuration.

### Situation-Specific Optimization
Tailor your agent's approach to each unique scenario—formal for business inquiries, friendly for customer support.

### Quick Testing
Test different configurations instantly without going through a full setup process each time.

### Automatic Reset
Your agent returns to its default settings after completing the task—no manual switching required.

### Best Practices

1. **Identify patterns** where your agent might benefit from a different approach
2. **Start with small changes** to see how they affect performance
3. **Save successful templates** for situations that repeat
4. **Test before using** in important scenarios

### How to Implement Task Templates

Watch this quick demonstration to see task templates in action:

<div style={{ width: "100%", position: "relative", paddingTop: "61.46%" }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/j15uupb5h3"
    frameBorder="0"
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      borderRadius: "10px"
    }}
    allow="autoplay; fullscreen"

  />
</div>

### In Summary

Task templates give you the flexibility to adapt your agent's behavior for specific situations without permanently changing its settings. This means you can optimize for different scenarios while maintaining consistency in your overall AI experience.

Think of task templates as giving your agent different "hats" to wear for specific jobs—the perfect balance between consistency and adaptability.
