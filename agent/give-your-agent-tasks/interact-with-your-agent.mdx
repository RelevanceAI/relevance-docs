## **Agent Chat**

### What is Agent Chat?

Agent Chat gives your Relevance AI agents a friendly, modern chat interface that your users will love. It's like giving your AI a professional "storefront" where people can easily interact with it.

Think of it as the difference between talking to someone through a clunky intercom versus having a face-to-face conversation at a well-designed help desk.

### Why You'll Love It

- **Looks Professional**: Creates a polished, branded experience that builds trust
- **Works Anywhere**: Easily embeds into your website, app, or other digital spaces
- **Fully Customizable**: Matches your brand colors, style, and messaging
- **User-Friendly**: Provides an intuitive interface people already know how to use

### Key Features

### Conversational Interface

Agent Chat provides a clean, familiar messaging experience that feels natural to users. No technical knowledge required - if they've ever used a messaging app, they'll feel right at home.

The interface supports flowing conversations that make even complex interactions feel simple and accessible.

### Upload Files

Users can easily share documents, images, and other files directly in the chat, making it simple to provide context or get help with specific materials.

### Talk to Your Agent

Enable voice interactions for situations where typing isn't convenient or accessible.

### Embed Anywhere

Place your AI assistant exactly where users need help:

- Add it to your website with a simple embed code
- Deploy as a chat widget that appears on any web page
- Maintain consistent branding across all touchpoints

This flexibility means you can put AI assistance precisely where it delivers the most value.

### Customization Options

Make the chat experience truly yours:

- Match your brand colors and icons

### Important Considerations

- Chat interactions use credits from your Relevance AI account

- Plan when and how to escalate complex issues to human support
