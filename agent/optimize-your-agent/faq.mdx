## How can I provide knowledge to an Agent?
General information can be included in the prompt. For large sources of data, we 
recommend uploading the data and build a Tool for knowledge retrieval. Then equip
the agent with the corresponding Tool.

Note that even though Agents are capable of receiving an input file, they need a 
Tool to analyze the data.

## Can I communicate with an Agent via API calls?
Absolutely!
