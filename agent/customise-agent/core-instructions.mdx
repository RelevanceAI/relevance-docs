Core instructions guide your agent's behavior and decision-making process.

When writing instructions, clearly state the agent's role and primary objectives, and outline step-by-step procedures for it's tasks.

It can also be helpful to give your agent examples of scenarios it might encounter, and examples of it's expected responses.

#### Markdown support

We offer markdown support for any area that accepts LLM prompts, like the core instructions, the flow builder and the LLM tool steps.

LLMs are well-trained on markdown and can draw meaning from your headings and bullet points to improve how they interpret your prompt. Using Markdown to create your prompts allows you to create a prompt that is easier for humans to read, and also easier for an LLM to understand.

Here is a table of markdown formatting options you can use when writing your prompts. If you're using windows, replace `Cmd` with `Ctrl` and `Opt` with `Alt`.

| Element           | Shortcut               | Markdown Syntax                                             |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bold              | `Cmd+B`                | `**bold text**`                                             |
| Italics           | `Cmd+I`                | `*italicized text*`                                         |
| Heading 1-6       | `Cmd+1`, ... `Cmd+6`   | `# Large heading`, `###### Small heaidng`             |
| Bullet Lists      | `Cmd+Shift+8`          | `- List items start with a dash`, or a `*` or `+`. Nest sub-items with 2 spaces or tabs.                   |
| Numbered Lists    | `Cmd+Shift+7`          | `1. List items start with a number`                |
| Horizontal Rule   | `Cmd+Shift+-`          | `---`                                                       |
| Code              | `Cmd+E`                | \`code\`                                                |
| Code Block        | `Cmd+Shift+E`          | \`\`\` code block \`\`\`                                        |


You can also select variables and reference tools and sub agents:

- Select a variable: Type in `{{` to bring up the variable picker name. Variables appear in your document surrounded in curly braces, like this: `{{selected_variable}}`.
- Reference a tool: Type in `/` to bring up the reference picker. Here you will be able to select tools or agents etc that you want to reference in your prompt.
