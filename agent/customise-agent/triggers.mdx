## Understand triggers

Triggers are ways to initiate an agent's task. Relevance AI offers several ways to activate your agent:

Manual Trigger: send a message to your agent via the Relevance AI interface.
Integration Triggers: select from one of our prebuilt integrations triggers.
Webhook Trigger: handle incoming webhooks to trigger your agent.
API Trigger: programmatically initiate tasks using the Relevance AI API.

## Set up triggers

In the left side bar, click **Integrations**. Here, you'll see a list of options to connect. Once you've added an account to your chosen integration, head back to your agent's edit interface.

In **Agent profile** under the **Integrations** section, you'll find available triggers. Select the one you need, and configure the the trigger settings.

You'll be able to customize how and when your agent processes events from this trigger to align with your work habits.

While Relevance has many built in triggers, if you don't see the third party service you want to use in our list of options, you can try using custom webhook, Zapier or API to build your own trigger.
