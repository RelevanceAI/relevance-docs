Sometimes one agent isn't enough to handle complex tasks, and that's where subagents come in. Subagents are specialized agents that work under a main 'manager' agent, creating a hierarchical structure that allows for more sophisticated and diverse task handling. This feature in Relevance enables you to build advanced multi-agent systems, mimicking the structure of human teams.


## Why use subagents?

**Specialization:** Just as human teams have members with different expertise, subagents can be designed to excel in specific domains or tasks. For example, you might have one subagent specialized in data analysis, another in customer communication, and a third in scheduling.

**Scalability:** Complex workflows can be broken down into manageable parts, each handled by a different subagent. This modular approach allows you to tackle intricate processes more efficiently and makes it easier to scale your AI operations as needs grow.

**Flexibility:** By combining different subagents, you can create versatile AI systems capable of handling a wide range of tasks without the need to build a single, overly complex agent.

### How to set up subagents

Navigate to the "Subagents" section in your main agent's settings. This is where you'll manage your AI team.

Click "Add Subagent" to select from existing agents. You can choose agents you've already created or build new ones specifically for this purpose.

For each subagent, you have three options for how your manager agent interacts with them:

**Autorun:** The subagent is automatically activated when needed, without requiring approval.

**Approval required:** The manager agent must get permission before activating the subagent.

**Let agent decide:** The manager agent uses its judgment to determine whether to autorun or seek approval.

These options allow you to balance autonomy and control in your multi-agent system.

When adding subagents, consider the following best practices:

- Clearly define the role and responsibilities of each subagent.
- Ensure efficient communication protocols between the manager agent and subagents.
- Regularly review and optimize your agent hierarchy to improve overall performance.
