When you need to modify an agent's behavior for a single task or a specific scenario, you can change the task template settings. This lets you make temporary adjustments without altering the agent's core configuration.

Let's say your agent has a template setting for a 'friendly personality' which generally defines how the agent interacts. This setting probably works for most tasks, but there might be situations where you want to temporarily adjust it. If you need the agent to adopt a more serious tone for a particular task, you can override the 'personality' setting just for that interaction.

This override capability allows you to fine-tune your agent's behavior on the fly without the need to save changes to the overall agent settings. It's like giving your agent a temporary persona or skill set, tailored to the specific requirements of a single task.

Once the task is complete, your agent reverts to its default settings automatically. This means you can experiment with different configurations or respond to unique situations without worrying about permanently altering your agent.
