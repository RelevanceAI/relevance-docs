<Tip>
Start by automating one specific task that takes up a lot of your team's time. Once you see success with that, you can expand your agent's capabilities to handle more complex workflows.
</Tip>

## Getting started

To build your first sales agent, you'll need:

1. **Define your use case** - What specific sales task do you want to automate? Start with something concrete like "research and qualify inbound leads" or "send personalized follow-up emails."

2. **Gather your knowledge** - Upload your sales playbooks, email templates, objection handling guides, and any other resources your agent should reference.

3. **Connect your tools** - Integrate with your CRM, email provider, and any other tools your agent needs to access.

4. **Build and test** - Use Relevance AI's visual builder to create your agent, then test it with a small batch of prospects before scaling up.

<Note>
Your sales agent is fully customizable. You can edit prompts, adjust workflows, and fine-tune behavior to match your exact sales process and brand voice.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need coding knowledge to build a sales agent?">
    No! Relevance AI's visual builder lets you create agents using a drag-and-drop interface. You just need to describe what you want your agent to do and configure it through the UI.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I ensure my agent follows my sales process?">
    You can customize your agent's instructions, prompts, and workflows to match your exact sales process. Upload your sales playbooks and templates to knowledge, and your agent will reference them when making decisions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can my sales agent integrate with my existing tools?">
    Yes! Relevance AI supports integrations with popular CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive), email providers (Gmail, Outlook), LinkedIn, and many other tools through our API step or built-in integrations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know if my agent is working correctly?">
    Start by running your agent in approval mode, where it will suggest actions but wait for your confirmation before executing them. Once you're confident in its performance, you can switch to autopilot mode.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if a prospect asks something my agent doesn't know?">
    You can configure escalation rules so your agent automatically hands off complex questions or situations to a human team member. The agent will provide full context about the conversation so your team can seamlessly take over.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How personalized can the agent's messages be?">
    Very personalized! Your agent can research each prospect, reference their company's recent news, mention specific pain points, and tailor messaging based on their industry, role, and company size. The more knowledge you provide, the more personalized the outreach becomes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my existing email templates?">
    Absolutely. Upload your email templates to knowledge, and your agent can use them as examples or reference them when crafting messages. You can also use few-shot prompting to teach your agent your writing style.
