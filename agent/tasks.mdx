## What are agent tasks?

Tasks are the individual jobs that your agents work on. Your agents may work on thousands of tasks a day!

Agents use their Tools to complete these tasks. They consider their Prompt when figuring out how to approach each task.

Tasks come from Triggers. When you create a new task in Relevance AI, you're using a manual trigger. However, your agent may receive tasks from any amount of connected triggers.

## Tasks vs. Prompt

It's very common for new users to confuse their agent's tasks and prompt - they're both instructions provided to the LLM.

The prompt is the core set of instructions that your agent follows every time it works on a task. Think of it like the instructions you'd provide to a junior employee about how they should work. You might tell them about their responsibilities, common processes and ways to communicate.

Tasks are the specific jobs that your agent needs to work on. Think of it like messaging your employee to ask them to do something. They will approach it based on what tools they have and what instructions you've given them about how to work.
