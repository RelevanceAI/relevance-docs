## Webhook Triggers

Webhook triggers enable you to initiate agent tasks through HTTP requests from external systems. This powerful integration method allows you to connect virtually any third-party service to your Relevance AI agents without requiring native support.

### Key Features

- **Custom Webhook URLs**: Each webhook trigger provides a unique URL that receives incoming requests and activates your agent.
- **Flexible Payload Formatting**: You have complete control over how incoming data is processed. Use template variables with double brackets (e.g., `{{first_name}}`) to personalize messages or include the entire payload with `{{$}}`.
- **Thread ID Mapping**: For continuous conversations, map a specific field from your payload to serve as a Thread ID. This ensures new information is added to the same agent conversation, perfect for chatbot implementations.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Map a Unique ID field to prevent processing the same event multiple times, ensuring data integrity and avoiding redundant operations.

### Setting Up a Webhook Trigger

1. Navigate to your agent's settings and select the Triggers section
2. Choose "Webhook Trigger" from the available options
3. Configure your webhook settings:
    - Customize the message template using variable placeholders
    - Map Thread ID and Unique ID fields as needed
    - Copy your unique webhook URL for integration with external systems

### Implementation Examples

Webhook triggers can be used for various automation scenarios:

- Trigger customer support responses when new tickets are created
- Process form submissions from your website
- Respond to events from third-party platforms
- Create automated workflows between different systems
