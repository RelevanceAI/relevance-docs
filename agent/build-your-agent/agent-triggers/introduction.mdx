### Triggers Overview

Triggers allow your Agent to start workflows automatically based on specific events.\
For example, connecting a Gmail trigger will let your Agent process each new email as soon as it arrives in your inbox. Based on your **Prompt** instructions, the Agent can then take action whenever an email "triggers" it.

You can trigger your Agent through three different methods:

- **Scheduled Events**: Set your agent to run at specific times or intervals
- **External Actions**: Configure your agent to respond to specific events or inputs
- **Manual Activation**: Allow users to directly engage with the agent when needed

Imagine you set up a Gmail trigger for your Agent.

Now, every time a new email arrives in your connected Gmail account, your Agent can automatically process it in real-time.

You can then ask your Agent questions like, "Did I get any emails from [specific person] today?" or "Summarize the important messages from this morning."

With just a trigger and the right instructions, you've effectively created a basic Executive Assistant:\
an Agent that monitors your inbox, understands what's important, and can send you updates every hour — all without you having to manually check.

How does this work? It all comes down to the **Prompt Instructions** you gave your Agent earlier — where you tell it exactly how to read, prioritize, and act on new emails.

## How to use Triggers

For each Trigger, connect to the integration using your associated credentials. For more information about setting up specific triggers, refer to the integration-specific documentation.
