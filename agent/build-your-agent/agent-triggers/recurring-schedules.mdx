## What are Recurring Schedules?

Recurring Schedules let your AI agents run automatically at set times without you having to start them manually. This is perfect for automating repetitive tasks that need to happen on a regular basis.

## Why Use Recurring Schedules?

- **Save time** by automating repetitive tasks
- **Never miss important processes** - they run even if you forget
- **Maintain consistency** in your workflows
- **Keep things running** outside business hours

## Setting Up a Recurring Schedule

Setting up is simple:

1. Go to your agent in the Relevance AI dashboard
2. Click 'Edit Agent'
3. Navigate to the 'Triggers' section
4. Select 'Recurring Schedule'
5. Choose your schedule type

## Schedule Types

You have two options for configuring recurring schedules:

### Simple Schedule Options

| Schedule Type | What It Does | Perfect For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Daily** | Runs every day at a time you choose | Morning reports, daily check-ins |
| **Weekly** | Runs on specific days each week | Team updates, weekly newsletters |
| **Monthly** | Runs on chosen dates each month | Monthly reports, regular maintenance |
| **Custom** | Runs on specific dates you select | One-off tasks or irregular schedules |

### Advanced: Cron Expressions

For more precise control over scheduling, you can use **Cron expressions**. Relevance AI uses **AWS EventBridge cron format**, which requires **six fields**:

```
minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week year
```

**Cron Expression Format:**

| Field | Values | Wildcards |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Minute** | 0-59 | , - * / |
| **Hour** | 0-23 | , - * / |
| **Day-of-month** | 1-31 | , - * ? / L W |
| **Month** | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | , - * / |
| **Day-of-week** | 1-7 or SUN-SAT | , - * ? L # |
| **Year** | 1970-2199 | , - * / |

**Special Characters:**

- `*` (asterisk) - all values
- `?` (question mark) - no specific value (used in day-of-month or day-of-week)
- `-` (dash) - range of values
- `,` (comma) - additional values
- `/` (forward slash) - increments
- `L` - last day of month or week
- `W` - nearest weekday
- `#` - nth occurrence of a day in a month

**Common Cron Expression Examples:**

```
0 10 * * ? *        # Every day at 10:00 AM
0 0 * * MON *       # Every Monday at midnight
0 9 1 * ? *         # First day of every month at 9:00 AM
0 0 * * MON-FRI *   # Weekdays at midnight
*/15 * * * ? *      # Every 15 minutes
0 9,17 * * ? *      # Daily at 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM
0 0 1,15 * ? *      # 1st and 15th of every month at midnight
0 8 ? * 2 *         # Every Monday (day 2) at 8:00 AM
0 10 L * ? *        # Last day of every month at 10:00 AM
0 9 ? * 2#1 *       # First Monday of every month at 9:00 AM
```

<Note>
AWS EventBridge cron expressions use 6 fields, unlike traditional Unix cron which uses 5 fields. Always include the year field, and use `?` for either day-of-month or day-of-week when specifying the other.
</Note>

## Real-World Examples

**For Marketing Teams:**

Set your agent to gather social media metrics every Monday morning and prepare a weekly performance report.

**For Sales Teams:**

Schedule daily updates on new leads and automatic follow-up messages to prospects who haven't responded in 3 days.

**For Operations:**

Create monthly inventory reports that run automatically on the 1st of each month.

## Pro Tips

- **Start small**: Begin with one simple recurring task before setting up complex schedules
- **Test thoroughly**: Run your agent manually first to ensure it works as expected
- **Monitor initially**: Check the first few automated runs to confirm everything works correctly
- **Use cron for precision**: When you need exact timing control, use cron expressions instead of simple schedules
