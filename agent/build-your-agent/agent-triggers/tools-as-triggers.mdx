<Warning>While this feature is functional, it has not gone through extensive user experience (UX) testing and improvements. We recognise that the usability may not be optimal right now, but we’re committed to making enhancements in future updates to ensure a smoother experience for everyone. We have more documentation on this feature once it moves past the beta stage.</Warning>

The 'Tools as a Trigger' feature allows users to create custom tools that can act as triggers for agents. This means you can combine data from various sources, like Salesforce and Airtable, to filter and process only the most relevant records. It’s designed to enhance your workflow by providing greater customisation and advanced logic.

<Note>In order to use this feature, the Tool you use as a Trigger's output must be an **array**.</Note>
