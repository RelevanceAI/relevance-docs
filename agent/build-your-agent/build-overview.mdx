## Welcome to the Build page!
Here, you’ll customize every part of your Agent — from defining its behavior to connecting tools, setting variables, and configuring task triggers.

The Build process is sectioned into clear settings to make building your Agent simple and structured:

1. **Prompt**: Write the core instructions that guide how your Agent thinks, acts, and responds.
2. **Tools**: Connect the actions your Agent can take, such as sending emails, posting to Slack, or retrieving data.
3. **Triggers**: Define when and how your Agent should take action automatically.
4. **Escalations**: Set up backup workflows if tasks can't be completed successfully.
5. **Metadata**: Add important labels, tags, and additional information to organize and enhance your Agent.
6. **Variables**: Create dynamic placeholders that let your Agent personalize its actions based on different inputs.
7. **Advanced**: Tweak advanced settings like connecting subagents, temperature, etc. 

<Tip>You can learn about these settings in any order, but we recommend starting with the Prompt since it’s the foundation of how your Agent will behave.</Tip>

Once you've finished configuring all the pieces, your Agent will be ready to take on **tasks** and deliver results!
