## Notifications

If your Agent ever gets stuck or needs a decision it can't make on its own, you can set up notifications to stay in the loop. Add your email address or connect a Slack channel, and the Agent will ping you when something needs human attention. This is especially helpful for Agents handling critical tasks where you don't want silent failures.


### Key Benefits

### Real-Time Team Alerts

Your team receives instant Slack or email notifications when the AI needs human expertise, ensuring urgent customer needs are addressed promptly.


### Seamless Customer Experience

Customers enjoy a smooth conversation flow even when human expertise is needed—the transition happens behind the scenes.


### Common Use Cases

- Complex technical support issues requiring specialized knowledge
- Sensitive customer service situations needing human empathy
- Detailed product feedback that should reach product managers
- High-value sales opportunities requiring personalized attention

### Escalate to manager

![](/images/agent/escalate.png)

When you configure the Escalations feature, it will add an 'Escalate to Manager' tool into your agent. You can configure when your agent chooses to escalate tasks by adding the 'Escalate to Manager' tool into your prompt with the "/" command and clicking on it.

## Tool Approvals

### Auto Run
 
 With this setting, the tool runs automatically whenever the agent determines it should be used. This provides the smoothest user experience as the agent can seamlessly incorporate tool functionality without interrupting the conversation flow.
 
 **Best for:** Tools that are low-risk, frequently used, or where immediate action is beneficial.
 
 ### Approval Required
 
 In this mode, the agent will ask for explicit permission before using the tool. When the agent determines a tool would be helpful, it will first explain what it wants to do and why, then wait for user confirmation before proceeding.
 
 **Best for:** Tools that perform sensitive actions, have potential costs associated with them, or where user oversight is important.
 
 ### Let Agent Decide
 
 This balanced approach gives your agent the flexibility to determine when approval is necessary based on context. The agent will use its judgment about when to ask for permission versus when to proceed automatically.
 
 **Best for:** A mix of tool types where you want to balance convenience with appropriate caution.
 

## Behavior if Tool Errors
---
### Use Custom Settings
#### Always Retry Errored Tool/Subagent

Some failures are just bad luck — like a tool timing out or a service being briefly unavailable. By turning this setting on, you're telling the Agent to automatically retry failed actions a few times before giving up. If you leave it off, the Agent will decide on its own whether it's worth retrying. For most users, enabling retries is a safe way to handle occasional hiccups without manual intervention.

---

#### Maximum Number of Tools/Subagents Retries

This setting controls how many times the Agent will retry a failed tool before calling it quits. A few retries (like 3) usually strikes a good balance — it gives your Agent a second chance without risking long loops or extra costs. You can raise or lower the number depending on how critical task success is for you.

<Warning>
  **Important:** Each retry counts as a separate tool execution toward your **Agent Autonomy Limit**. If you set this to 3 retries, a single failed tool could consume up to 3 executions of your autonomy limit.
</Warning>

---

#### Behavior After Max Tool/Subagent Retries

Once the Agent hits the maximum retries and still can't succeed, you decide what happens next: either **Terminate the Task** immediately or (if available) **Escalate** it to a human for help. Terminating is faster and simpler, but escalation gives you a chance to fix things manually when it matters most.

## Understanding Retries and Autonomy Limits

When configuring retry settings, it's important to understand how they interact with your Agent Autonomy Limit:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How Retries Count Toward Autonomy Limits">
    The Agent Autonomy Limit tracks **all consecutive tool executions**, not distinct tool invocations. This means:
    
    - Every retry counts as a separate execution
    - If Tool A retries 3 times and Tool B retries 2 times, that's 5 executions toward your autonomy limit
    - Retries accumulate across all tools in a workflow
    
    **Example:** If Tool A has a max retry of 3 and runs 3 times, then Tool B runs 7 times (including retries), that equals an autonomy limit of 10 (3 + 7 = 10).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Impact on Credits and Costs">
    Each retry is treated as a separate action for billing purposes:
    
    - **Credits/Actions:** Every retry consumes credits or actions from your plan
    - **Vendor Credits:** Each retry that uses an LLM or external API incurs additional vendor costs
    - **Total Cost:** A tool that retries 3 times will cost 3x the normal amount
    
    Consider this when setting your maximum retry limits, especially for tools that use expensive models or APIs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Best Practices for Retry Configuration">
    To optimize retry settings while managing autonomy limits:
    
    - **Set realistic retry limits:** 2-3 retries is usually sufficient for transient failures
    - **Increase autonomy limits accordingly:** If you have multiple tools with retries enabled, ensure your autonomy limit can accommodate all potential retries
    - **Monitor retry patterns:** Review your agent's performance to identify tools that frequently retry and address underlying issues
    - **Use escalations wisely:** Configure escalations for critical workflows where human intervention is valuable after retries are exhausted
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  When planning your agent's configuration, calculate the maximum possible tool executions by adding up all potential retries across your tools. Set your Agent Autonomy Limit higher than this total to ensure your agent can complete its work without hitting the limit prematurely.
