## What are Scheduled Messages?

Scheduled Messages enable your AI agents to send messages at specific times in the future, creating a more dynamic and proactive experience. Unlike other triggers that start new agent runs, **Scheduled Messages restart existing conversations** - allowing your agent to continue where it left off with full context of previous interactions.

<Note>
**Key Differentiator:** Scheduled Messages don't create new agent conversations or runs. Instead, they re-activate and continue preexisting conversations, maintaining conversation history and context.
</Note>

With the latest update, you can easily edit or reschedule these messages directly in Task View - no need to start over if plans change!

<Info>
Scheduled Messages is available on the **Pro plan and above**. Learn more about our [pricing plans](/get-started/subscriptions/new-pricing).

## Built-in Scheduled Message Tools

When you enable Scheduled Messages, two powerful tools are automatically added to your agent:

### Create Scheduled Trigger

This tool allows your agent to schedule a message for a specific time in the future. The agent can use this tool whenever it determines a future message would be helpful.

**When to use:**
- Setting up follow-up messages
- Creating reminders for specific dates/times
- Building multi-step communication sequences
- Scheduling check-ins after events

### Delete Scheduled Trigger

This tool enables your agent to cancel previously scheduled messages when they're no longer needed.

**When to use:**
- User completes a task before the reminder
- Plans change and the scheduled message is no longer relevant
- User requests to cancel a scheduled follow-up
- Replacing an old scheduled message with a new one

## Integrating Scheduled Messages in Your Prompt

The key to effective Scheduled Messages is clear instructions in your agent's Prompt. Here's how to guide your agent on when and how to use scheduling:

### Basic Prompt Integration

Add instructions like these to your agent's Prompt:

```
When someone asks about upcoming events, schedule a reminder 24 hours before each event.

If someone has a deadline, schedule a check-in halfway to the deadline and another one day before.

For multi-step processes, schedule messages at each milestone to keep people on track.
```

### Advanced Prompt Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Customer Support">
    ```
    When resolving a customer issue:
    1. Schedule a follow-up message 24 hours after resolution to ask "How is everything working now?"
    2. If the customer mentions an upcoming deadline, schedule a check-in 2 days before
    3. For complex issues, schedule a 1-week follow-up to ensure long-term satisfaction
    
    When a scheduled follow-up is triggered:
    - Reference the original issue in your message
    - Ask specific questions about the resolution
    - Offer additional help if needed
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Sales Follow-up">
    ```
    After initial contact with a prospect:
    1. Schedule a follow-up message 3 days later if no response
    2. If they express interest but aren't ready, schedule a check-in based on their timeline
    3. After sending a proposal, schedule a follow-up 2 business days later
    
    When restarted by a scheduled trigger:
    - Acknowledge the previous conversation
    - Provide additional value or information
    - Include a clear call-to-action
    - If still no response after 2 follow-ups, schedule a final check-in 1 week later
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Onboarding">
    ```
    When a new user signs up:
    1. Schedule a "Day 2" message with tips for getting started
    2. Schedule a "Day 5" message highlighting advanced features
    3. Schedule a "Day 14" message asking for feedback
    
    When sending scheduled onboarding messages:
    - Personalize based on their usage patterns
    - Provide specific, actionable tips
    - Include links to relevant resources
    - Encourage questions and engagement
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Project Management">
    ```
    When managing project tasks:
    1. Schedule reminders 2 days before any deadline
    2. For tasks without updates in 3 days, schedule a status check-in
    3. Schedule milestone celebration messages when phases complete
    
    When restarted for project updates:
    - Summarize current project status
    - Highlight any blockers or delays
    - Suggest next steps
    - Update or cancel scheduled messages if timelines change
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Handling Scheduled Trigger Restarts

It's crucial to instruct your agent on what to do when it's restarted by a scheduled trigger:

```
When you are restarted by a scheduled message trigger:
1. Review the conversation history to understand the context
2. Reference the previous interaction naturally
3. Provide the follow-up information or check-in as planned
4. Be helpful and conversational, not robotic
5. If the user responds, continue the conversation naturally
6. If appropriate, schedule additional follow-ups based on the response
```

## Scheduled Messages Settings

### Enable Scheduled Messages (Toggle)

Turn this on to allow your Agent to schedule actions or messages for the future. Without this enabled, your Agent can only respond in real-time and won't be able to set future reminders, follow-ups, or scheduled notifications.

### Max Daily Scheduled Triggers

Set a limit on how many scheduled actions your Agent can process in a single day. 

**Options:**
- **No limit**: The Agent can schedule and send as many future messages as needed
- **Custom limit**: Set a specific maximum number to control costs, manage system load, or prevent overactivity

<Tip>
Start with a reasonable limit (e.g., 50-100 per day) and adjust based on your actual usage patterns.
</Tip>

### Prevent Scheduled Messages from Interrupting a Task

When enabled, your Agent won't interrupt an active task (like when it's waiting for approvals or processing another action) just to send a scheduled message. Instead, the scheduled message will be delayed by at least the time you specify (default is 1,440 minutes, or 24 hours).

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents your Agent from getting confused or stuck
- Maintains conversation flow and context
- Avoids unpredictable behavior when juggling multiple actions
- Ensures scheduled messages don't interfere with critical workflows

<Warning>
If you disable this setting, scheduled messages may interrupt ongoing tasks, which could lead to unexpected behavior or conversation flow issues.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Clear Timing Instructions" icon="clock">
