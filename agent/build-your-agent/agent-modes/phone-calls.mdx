## Overview

The Phone agent mode allows you to configure your Agent to be a phone calling maestro\! You can set up your Agent to perform outbound calls, where it leverages your Agent's configured Tools in real-time during the call.

## How do I change my agent to the Phone Agent mode?

You can create a new Phone Agent, or convert your normal Agent to a Phone Agent. To convert your normal Agent to a Phone Agent, follow these steps.

</div>

1. Open your Agent, and click 'Advanced' to head to your Advanced Settings
2. Then, click 'Phone Call' on the Agent mode dropdown
3. Then, head to the new 'Phone Mode' section in the sidebar to configure your Settings

<Warning>
  In order for your Agent to work, it'll need to be part of a multi-agent system, where a Parent agent will send it info such as a number to call, info about the customer they're calling, etc. We recommend using a Workforce to do this. 
</Warning>
