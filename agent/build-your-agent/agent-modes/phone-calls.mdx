## Overview

The Phone agent mode allows you to configure your Agent to be a phone calling maestro! You can set up your Agent to perform outbound calls, where it leverages your Agent's configured Tools in real-time during the call.

## How do I change my Agent to the Phone agent mode? 

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    position: 'relative',
    paddingTop: '56.25%',
  }}>

    allowfullscreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%',
      border: '3px solid #5E43CE',
      borderRadius: '10px',
    }}/>
</div>

1. Open your Agent, and click 'Advanced' to head to your Advanced Settings
2. Then, click 'Phone Call' on the Agent mode dropdown
3. Add your Agent's first message and Agent's outbound phone number

<Warning>In order for your Agent to work, it'll need to be part of a multi-agent system, where a Parent agent will send it info such as a number to call, info about the customer they're calling, etc.</Warning>
