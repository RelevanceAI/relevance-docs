### Triggers Overview
 
Triggers allow your Agent to start workflows automatically based on specific events.  
For example, connecting a Gmail trigger will let your Agent process each new email as soon as it arrives in your inbox. Based on your **Prompt** instructions, the Agent can then take action whenever an email is "triggered."


Ways to Activate or Trigger Your Agent

- **Scheduled Events**: Set your agent to run at specific times or intervals
- **External Actions**: Configure your agent to respond to specific events or inputs
- **Manual Activation**: Allow users to directly engage with the agent when needed


## A Simple Example

Imagine you set up a Gmail trigger for your Agent.  

Now, every time a new email arrives in your connected Gmail account, your Agent can automatically process it in real-time.

You can then ask your Agent questions like, "Did I get any emails from [specific person] today?" or "Summarize the important messages from this morning."

With just a trigger and the right instructions, you've effectively created a basic Executive Assistant:  
an Agent that monitors your inbox, understands what’s important, and can send you updates every hour — all without you having to manually check.

How does this work?  
It all comes down to the **Prompt Instructions** you gave your Agent earlier — where you tell it exactly how to read, prioritize, and act on new emails.

## How to use Triggers

For each Trigger, connect to the integration using your associated credentials. For more information about setting up specific triggers, refer to the integration-specific documentation.

# Scheduled Messages Overview

### What are Scheduled Messages?

Scheduled Messages let your AI agents send messages in the future without you having to do anything. Instead of just responding when someone talks to them, your agents can now reach out at specific times you choose.

With the latest update, you can easily edit or reschedule these messages directly in Task View - no need to start over if plans change!

### Why Use Scheduled Messages?

Your agents can now:

- Send follow-ups automatically (like "How did that meeting go?")
- Set reminders for deadlines or events
- Create step-by-step communication sequences
- Send information exactly when it's needed
- Stay in touch with people across different time zones

### Setting Up Scheduled Messages

It's easy to get started:

1. Navigate to the **Build** page
2. Look for the **Triggers** section
3. Scroll to the bottom and turn on the **Enabled Scheduled Messages** toggle
4. Add instructions in your agent's core instructions about when to schedule messages

Once turned on, your agent will understand time-based requests like "send a follow-up tomorrow at 9 AM" or "remind me about this next Tuesday."

## Making the Most of Scheduled Messages

### In Your Agent's Instructions

Tell your agent when to schedule messages by adding **Prompt** instructions like:

```
When someone asks about upcoming events, schedule a reminder 24 hours before each event.

If someone has a deadline, schedule a check-in halfway to the deadline.

For multi-step processes, schedule messages at each milestone to keep people on track.

```

# Scheduled Messages Settings

## Enabled Scheduled Messages (Toggle)

Turn this on to allow your Agent to schedule actions or messages for the future.  
Without this enabled, your Agent can only respond in real-time and won't be able to set future reminders, follow-ups, or scheduled notifications.

---

## Max Daily Scheduled Triggers (Textbox)

Set a limit on how many scheduled actions your Agent can process in a single day.  
Leaving it at "No limit" means the Agent can schedule and send as many future messages as needed.  
If you want to control costs, manage system load, or prevent overactivity, you can set a specific maximum number.

---

## Prevent Scheduled Messages from Interrupting a Task (Toggle + Time Setting)

When this is enabled, your Agent won't interrupt an active task (like when it's waiting for approvals or processing another action) just to send a scheduled message.  
Instead, the scheduled message will wait and be delayed by at least the time you specify (default is 1,440 minutes, or 24 hours).

This prevents your Agent from getting confused, stuck, or behaving unpredictably when juggling multiple actions.

---

## Schedule Message (Tool)

A built-in tool your Agent can use when writing prompts.  
Use the `/schedule message` shortcut inside your Agent's instructions to tell it exactly when and what to schedule automatically during conversations.

Example:  
> "After summarizing today's emails, schedule a check-in message tomorrow at 10 AM."
