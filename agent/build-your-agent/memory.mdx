## Overview

Memory in Relevance AI allows your agent to remember and recall information during and across conversations. There are two types of memory that serve different purposes:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Short-Term Memory" icon="list" href="#short-term-memory">
    Also known as **Metadata**
    
    What your agent remembers during a **single conversation** or agent run. This information is used to maintain context and consistency throughout that specific interaction.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Long-Term Memory" icon="brain" href="#long-term-memory">
    Persistent across all conversations
    
    What your agent remembers across **all conversations and agent runs** moving forward. This persistent memory allows your agent to build upon previous interactions and provide personalized experiences over time.
  </Card>
</Columns>

These memory systems help make your conversations:
- **Searchable** - Find exactly what you need
- **Filterable** - Sort conversations by specific criteria  
- **Consistent** - Ensure the same data is used throughout conversations
- **Intuitive** - Easily recall and update memorized data when needed

## Short-Term Memory

<Info>Short-Term Memory is also known as Metadata.</Info>

Short-Term Memory allows your agent to remember information throughout one conversation. Setup organized memory metadata that your agent can recognize and update as each conversation progresses. This not only can improve the effectiveness of an agent but also can be used to filter, search and analyze tasks.

<Note>
When using short-term memory in a Workforce with multiple agents, the metadata persists throughout the entire workforce run as long as agents are configured to "continue same task" (rather than "create new task"). This means all agents in the workflow can read and update the same metadata, making it useful for tracking information across your entire multi-agent process.
</Note>

Adding Short-Term Memory allows you to enrich and recall your data with additional context:

1. Navigate to the Build tab located at the top of your screen, adjacent to Tasks
2. Click on "Memory" in the left sidebar navigation menu
3. Choose your extraction method (Agent-decided or Rule-based)
4. Define the appropriate data format and configure your settings
5. Click the "Save" button to apply your changes

<Tip>
Consider what information would be most valuable for future analysis when deciding which metadata to add. Focus on data points that will help you segment, filter, or understand patterns in your agent interactions.
</Tip>

### Delete Memory

To remove memory that's no longer needed:

1. Find the memory field you want to remove in the Memory page
2. Click the delete (trash) icon next to the field

<Warning>
Deleting memory is permanent and will remove this information from all associated conversations or tasks. Make sure you no longer need this data before proceeding.
</Warning>

### Edit Memory Field

To modify an existing memory field:

1. Find the memory field you want to edit in the Memory page
2. Click the edit (pencil) icon next to the field
3. Update the field name, data format, or extraction method as needed
4. Save your changes

### Memory Extraction Methods

Relevance AI offers two approaches for extracting memory metadata:

#### Let Agent Decide

With this option, you provide instructions to your agent about how and when to extract fields from memory. You define guidelines for the agent to follow when determining memory values, making it ideal for complex scenarios where context-aware judgment is needed.

#### Rule Based

Improve memory accuracy by defining specific conditions based on tools & triggers. This approach is either triggered to update after tool run or after trigger received, making it perfect for consistent, predictable data points that follow clear patterns.

### Data Formats for Short-Term Memory

You can add the following data formats as metadata:

1. **Text** - Free-form text entries for descriptions, notes, or other unstructured information
2. **Number** - Numerical values for quantitative data, supporting integers and decimal values
3. **True/False** - Binary values for yes/no or true/false conditions
4. **Single Option** - Predefined list where only one value can be selected
5. **Multiple Option** - Predefined list where multiple values can be selected

<Tip>
Choose the appropriate data format based on how you plan to use the metadata later. For example, if you want to calculate averages or totals, use the number format. If you need to filter by specific categories, single or multiple option formats work best.
</Tip>

### Built-in Tools

When metadata is added to the Agent, the following built-in tools will be automatically added:

- **Add conversation metadata** - Allows you to add conversation metadata during agent interactions
- **Read conversation metadata** - Enables reading existing conversation metadata

This then allows you to add to the Prompt when you want to add conversation metadata, giving you more control over when and how metadata is captured and used.

### Filtering by Short-Term Memory

You can filter your Workforces and Agent conversations/runs by Short-Term Memory metadata. For example, if you've built an agent that uses metadata like an email or user ID for each person, you can filter agent runs by a person's email or ID to see all their interactions.

### Best Practices

- **Be consistent**: Use standardized naming conventions and values for your memory fields
- **Start small**: Begin with a few key memory fields and expand as needed
- **Review regularly**: Periodically assess which memory fields are providing value
- **Document your schema**: Keep track of what each memory field represents and how it should be used

By effectively utilizing memory, you can transform raw conversation data into structured, actionable insights that drive better decision-making and agent performance.

### Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does short-term memory persist across agents in a Workforce?">
    Yes. When agents in a Workforce are configured to 'continue same task,' short-term memory persists across all agents involved in that workforce run. This allows metadata to be shared and updated by multiple agents working on the same task. If agents are configured to 'create new task,' each agent will have its own separate short-term memory.

## Long-Term Memory 

Long-Term Memory allows your agent to remember information across different conversations. This is great for use cases like storing user preferences, frequently asked questions, and other persistent information that should be available in future interactions.

When Long-Term Memory is enabled, your agent will be able to read Long-Term Memory added to the agent as it goes.

### Built-in Tools

Two built-in tools will be automatically added to the agent:

- **Save to Memory**: Save important information to your Long-Term Memory for future conversations
- **Delete from Memory**: Remove information from your Long-Term Memory

<Info>
You don't have to use these tools, but they provide a good way to be more granular and control when to save Long-Term Memory based on certain conditions, after specific tools, or following particular workflows.
</Info>

You can view and manage stored memories from the Memory section of your agent.

### Advanced Settings

From the Advanced Settings in Long-Term Memory, you can:

- **Override the system prompt for saving to memory**: Customize how the agent decides what information to save
- **Override the system prompt for deleting from memory**: Control how the agent determines what to remove from memory
- **Disable delete memory tool**: When disabled, the agent cannot delete items from Long-Term Memory. This is useful when you want to ensure your agent can't accidentally lose important context by deleting memories

<Info>
Long-Term Memory is particularly valuable for maintaining context across multiple conversations, ensuring your agent can build upon previous interactions and provide more personalized experiences.
