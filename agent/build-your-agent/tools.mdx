Tools enhance your agent's capabilities, allowing it to perform specific tasks or access external resources.

In the edit agent interface, select **Tools** and choose from pre-built templates or add custom tools you've created under `Add new tool`.

You have a few options to configure usage:

**Auto run:** tool runs automatically when used by an agent.

**Approval required:** agent asks for permission before using the tool.

**Let agent decide:** agent determines when to use the tool based on context.

Finally, you can give your agent some guidance about how to use it's tools in it's core instructions and in the Flow Builder.
