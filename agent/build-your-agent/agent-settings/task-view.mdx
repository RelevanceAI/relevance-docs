## Task View Settings

### View Title

Enter a clear, descriptive name for your custom task view. This title will appear in the task view selector, making it easy to find and switch between your different task dashboards.

**Examples:**

- "Customer Support Tasks"
- "Sales Lead Follow-ups"
- "Content Approval Queue"

**Best Practice:** Choose a name that instantly communicates what type of tasks this view will display.

### Which Information to Include in the View

Use this search box to select specific tools or information sources you want to monitor in this view. Your custom view will only display tasks that involve the tools you've selected here.

**How it works:**

1. Type the name of a tool your Agent uses (e.g., "Send Email", "Extract Data", "Escalate to Slack")
2. Select the relevant tools from the dropdown results
3. Your view will automatically filter to show only tasks using these tools

**Why this matters:** By focusing on specific tools, you can create specialized dashboards that show only the task activity relevant to particular workflows or responsibilities.

### When to Use Custom Task Views

Task Views are particularly valuable when:

- Your Agent handles multiple types of tasks using different tools
- You need to monitor specific workflows separately
- You want to reduce clutter and focus only on certain types of Agent activity
- Different team members need to track different aspects of your Agent's work

By creating targeted views, you can efficiently monitor exactly what matters most to you without being overwhelmed by unrelated task activity.
