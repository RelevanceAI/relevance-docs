# Flow Builder

Flow Builder is a powerful feature that allows you to create sophisticated decision-making pathways for your AI agents. By implementing conditional logic through "if-then" statements, you can guide your agent's responses and actions based on specific scenarios and user inputs.

## Overview

The Flow Builder empowers you to give your agent more precise guidance about its tasks by creating conditional logic pathways. Rather than relying solely on general instructions, you can design complex, branching decision trees that help your agent navigate different scenarios with tailored responses and actions.

With Flow Builder, you can:

* Create conditional logic using "if-then" statements
* Build branching decision trees for different conversation paths
* Provide specific instructions for various scenarios
* Enhance your agent's ability to handle complex interactions

## How Flow Builder Works

Flow Builder operates on a simple yet powerful premise: when certain conditions are met, your agent will follow specific instructions. This conditional logic framework allows your agent to adapt its responses based on the context of the conversation, user inputs, or other variables.

### Creating Decision Trees

The Flow Builder interface allows you to visually construct decision pathways that your agent will follow. Each pathway consists of:

1. A condition that triggers the pathway
2. Specific instructions for the agent to follow when that condition is met
3. Optional branching paths for further conditional responses

By creating these structured decision trees, you can ensure your agent responds appropriately to different scenarios without having to include every possible variation in your core instructions.

## When to Use Flow Builder

Flow Builder is particularly valuable in the following situations:

* **Complex Customer Support Scenarios**: Create different response paths based on the type of issue a customer reports
