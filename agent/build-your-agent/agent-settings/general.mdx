### Suggest Replies

**What it is:** A toggle that enables automatic reply suggestions after each agent response.

**When to use it:** Enable this feature when you want to:

- Keep conversations flowing naturally
- Save time on typing common responses
- Provide users with quick response options

Simply toggle this on, and your agent will offer clickable reply suggestions after each of its messages.

### Agent Timeout Time

**What it is:** The maximum time your agent can work on a task before timing out.

**How to choose:**

- **Shorter timeouts:** More efficient for simple tasks, saves resources
- **Longer timeouts:** Necessary for complex reasoning, research tasks, or when working with multiple tools

Consider the complexity of your agent's typical tasks when setting this value.

### Instructions for Naming Tasks

**What it is:** Guidelines that help your agent create clear, consistent names for new tasks.

#### How It Works

When your agent creates a task, it uses the LLM to generate a name based on your instructions. The agent considers the full context—trigger data, workflow, and tools—to create meaningful names. These instructions act as a prompt template guiding the LLM's naming decision.

#### Writing Effective Instructions

- **Think about scanning:** Put the most important information first
- **Consider your workflow:** Align names with how you organize work
- **Be consistent:** Use the same format across similar agents
- **Include key identifiers:** Customer names, dates, action types, or outcomes
- **Test and iterate:** Run a few tasks and refine based on results

#### Examples by Use Case

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customer Support Agents">
    ```
    Name tasks using this format: [Customer Name] - [Request Type] - [Status]
    Example: John Smith - Refund Request - Completed
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Creation Agents">
    ```
    Start with the content type, followed by the topic and date.
    Example: Blog Post: AI Agents Guide - 2024-11-06
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Processing Agents">
    ```
    Include the data source and action performed.
    Example: Processed: LinkedIn Data Export - 150 records
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sales/Lead Management">
    ```
    Use format: [Company Name] - [Action] - [Outcome]
    Example: Acme Corp - Outreach Email - Sent
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Best Practices

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do" icon="circle-check" color="#10b981">
    Provide a clear format or structure for your task names, and make sure to include the most important identifying information first. Use consistent terminology that matches your workflow, and keep your instructions concise but specific. Don't forget to test with a few tasks and refine your instructions based on what works best for your needs.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Don't" icon="circle-xmark" color="#ef4444">
    Avoid making your instructions too vague or generic—the agent needs clear guidance to create useful names. Don't include variables that might not always be available in your workflow, and steer clear of complex conditional logic that could confuse the naming process. Remember to specify the order of information so your task names stay consistent.
  </Card>
</Columns>

#### Common Naming Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Chronological">
    **Format:** `[Date] - [Action] - [Subject]`
    
    **Example:** "2024-11-06 - Email Sent - Product Demo"
    
    **Best for:** Time-sensitive workflows, audit trails, sequential processes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hierarchical">
    **Format:** `[Project] > [Phase] > [Task]`
    
    **Example:** "Website Redesign > Development > API Integration"
    
    **Best for:** Complex projects with multiple levels, nested workflows
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Status-based">
    **Format:** `[Status] [Subject] - [Details]`
    
    **Example:** "Completed: Customer Onboarding - Acme Corp"
    
    **Best for:** Task tracking, progress monitoring, filtering by completion
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Actor-focused">
    **Format:** `[Who] - [What] - [When]`
    
    **Example:** "Sarah Johnson - Contract Review - Nov 6"
    
    **Best for:** Team collaboration, assignment tracking, accountability
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Guide for Using Agent

**What it is:** Simple instructions shown to users when they start a conversation with your agent.

**Best practices:**

- Keep it brief (1-3 sentences)
- Explain what the agent can help with
- Include any specific information users should provide

**Example:** "I'm your research assistant. Tell me what topic you're exploring, and I'll help find relevant information and summarize key points."

---

### Welcome Message

**What it is:** The first message your agent automatically sends at the start of every new task.

**Tips for effective welcome messages:**

- Introduce the agent's purpose
- Set clear expectations
- Include a prompt for the user to get started

**Example:** "Hi there! I'm Maya, your marketing assistant. I can help draft social posts, brainstorm campaign ideas, or analyze content performance. What would you like to work on today?"

---

### Default Prompt for Parent Agents

**What it is:** Instructions that guide how other agents should interact with this agent when working together.

**When to use it:** Configure this when building multi-agent workflows where agents need to collaborate.

This ensures consistent communication between agents and helps maintain workflow integrity.

---

### Export Agent

**What it is:** A button that downloads your agent's complete configuration as a .rai file (JSON format).

**When to use it:**

- Create backups before making major changes
- Share agent configurations with team members
- Transfer agents between environments
- Create templates for similar agents

Your exported file contains all settings, tools, and configurations.

---

### Agent Autonomy Limit

**What it is:** The maximum number of consecutive tool executions your agent can perform without human approval.

<Warning>
  The autonomy limit tracks **all consecutive tool executions**, not distinct tool invocations. This means tool retries count as separate executions toward your autonomy limit.
</Warning>

#### How It Works

The autonomy limit counts every single tool execution, including retries. For example:

- **Tool A** runs with a max auto-run limit of 3, and executes 3 times (including retries)
- **Tool B** then runs 7 times (including retries)
- **Total autonomy limit used:** 10 (3 + 7 = 10)

Each retry counts as a separate action for both **credit usage** and **autonomy limits**.

#### How to Set It

- **Lower values (5-10):** More human oversight, better for critical or sensitive tasks
- **Higher values (20-50+):** More independence, better for routine or time-sensitive workflows

<Tip>
  If your tools have retry settings enabled, factor those potential retries into your autonomy limit. A tool configured to retry 3 times could consume up to 3 executions of your autonomy limit if it continues to fail.
</Tip>

**Important:** Higher autonomy limits may require longer timeout settings to allow the agent to complete its work.
