### Suggest Replies

**What it is:** A toggle that enables automatic reply suggestions after each agent response.

**When to use it:** Enable this feature when you want to:

- Keep conversations flowing naturally
- Save time on typing common responses
- Provide users with quick response options

Simply toggle this on, and your agent will offer clickable reply suggestions after each of its messages.

### Agent Timeout Time

**What it is:** The maximum time your agent can work on a task before timing out.

**How to choose:**

- **Shorter timeouts:** More efficient for simple tasks, saves resources
- **Longer timeouts:** Necessary for complex reasoning, research tasks, or when working with multiple tools

Consider the complexity of your agent's typical tasks when setting this value.

### Instructions for Naming Tasks

**What it is:** Guidelines that help your agent create clear, consistent names for new tasks.

#### How It Works

When your agent creates a task, it uses the LLM to generate a name based on your instructions. The agent considers the full context—trigger data, workflow, and tools—to create meaningful names. These instructions act as a prompt template guiding the LLM's naming decision.

#### Writing Effective Instructions

- **Think about scanning:** Put the most important information first
- **Consider your workflow:** Align names with how you organize work
- **Be consistent:** Use the same format across similar agents
- **Include key identifiers:** Customer names, dates, action types, or outcomes
- **Test and iterate:** Run a few tasks and refine based on results

#### Examples by Use Case

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customer Support Agents">
    ```
    Name tasks using this format: [Customer Name] - [Request Type] - [Status]
    Example: John Smith - Refund Request - Completed
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Creation Agents">
    ```
    Start with the content type, followed by the topic and date.
    Example: Blog Post: AI Agents Guide - 2024-11-06
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Processing Agents">
    ```
    Include the data source and action performed.
    Example: Processed: LinkedIn Data Export - 150 records
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sales/Lead Management">
    ```
    Use format: [Company Name] - [Action] - [Outcome]
    Example: Acme Corp - Outreach Email - Sent
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Best Practices

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="DO" icon="circle-check" color="#10b981">
    - Provide a clear format or structure
    - Include the most important information first
    - Use consistent terminology
    - Keep instructions concise but specific
    - Test and refine based on results
  </Card>

  <Card title="DON'T" icon="circle-xmark" color="#ef4444">
    - Make instructions too vague
    - Include variables that might not be available
    - Use complex conditional logic
    - Forget to specify information order
  </Card>
</Columns>

#### Common Naming Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Chronological">
    **Format:** `[Date] - [Action] - [Subject]`
    
    **Example:** "2024-11-06 - Email Sent - Product Demo"
    
    **Best for:** Time-sensitive workflows, audit trails, sequential processes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hierarchical">
    **Format:** `[Project] > [Phase] > [Task]`
    
    **Example:** "Website Redesign > Development > API Integration"
    
    **Best for:** Complex projects with multiple levels, nested workflows
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Status-based">
    **Format:** `[Status] [Subject] - [Details]`
    
    **Example:** "Completed: Customer Onboarding - Acme Corp"
    
    **Best for:** Task tracking, progress monitoring, filtering by completion
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Actor-focused">
    **Format:** `[Who] - [What] - [When]`
    
    **Example:** "Sarah Johnson - Contract Review - Nov 6"
    
    **Best for:** Team collaboration, assignment tracking, accountability
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Guide for Using Agent

**What it is:** Simple instructions shown to users when they start a conversation with your agent.

**Best practices:**

- Keep it brief (1-3 sentences)
- Explain what the agent can help with
- Include any specific information users should provide

**Example:** "I'm your research assistant. Tell me what topic you're exploring, and I'll help find relevant information and summarize key points."

---

### Welcome Message

**What it is:** The first message your agent automatically sends at the start of every new task.

**Tips for effective welcome messages:**

- Introduce the agent's purpose
- Set clear expectations
- Include a prompt for the user to get started

**Example:** "Hi there! I'm Maya, your marketing assistant. I can help draft social posts, brainstorm campaign ideas, or analyze content performance. What would you like to work on today?"

---

### Default Prompt for Parent Agents

**What it is:** Instructions that guide how other agents should interact with this agent when working together.

**When to use it:** Configure this when building multi-agent workflows where agents need to collaborate.

This ensures consistent communication between agents and helps maintain workflow integrity.

---

### Export Agent

**What it is:** A button that downloads your agent's complete configuration as a .rai file (JSON format).

**When to use it:**

- Create backups before making major changes
- Share agent configurations with team members
- Transfer agents between environments
- Create templates for similar agents

Your exported file contains all settings, tools, and configurations.

---

### Agent Autonomy Limit

**What it is:** The number of consecutive actions your agent can take without human approval.

**How to set it:**

- **Lower values:** More human oversight, better for critical or sensitive tasks
- **Higher values:** More independence, better for routine or time-sensitive workflows

**Important:** Higher autonomy limits may require longer timeout settings to allow the agent to complete its work.
