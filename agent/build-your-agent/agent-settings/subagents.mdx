## Sub-Agent Settings

### Approval Mode

Choose how your parent Agent gets permission to use this Sub-agent:

* **Auto Run**: The Sub-agent runs automatically whenever needed, with no interruptions
* **Approval Required**: You'll be asked for permission each time before the Sub-agent runs

**When to use each option:**
* Choose **Auto Run** for routine, low-risk tasks you're comfortable automating completely
* Choose **Approval Required** when you need oversight for sensitive operations or actions with significant impact

### Max Auto-runs Before Approval

Set a limit on consecutive automatic runs before requiring your approval:

* **No limit**: The Sub-agent can run as many times as needed without stopping for approval
* **Custom number**: After reaching this number of runs within one task, the system will pause and ask for your permission

This setting helps you maintain control over resource usage and repetitive actions while still allowing automation where appropriate.

### Error Handling Behavior

Decide how errors should be managed when they occur:

* **Use Default Settings**: Follow your workspace's standard error handling rules
* **Use Custom Settings**: Create specific error handling instructions just for this Sub-agent

Custom settings are particularly useful when a Sub-agent needs special treatment for retries, escalations, or alternative workflows when something goes wrong.

## Communication Settings

### Usage Instructions

Write clear directions for when and how the parent Agent should use this Sub-agent:

```
Example: "Use this Research Sub-agent whenever you need to gather competitive information or market data. Provide specific search terms and the type of information needed."
```

Good instructions ensure the parent Agent knows exactly when to call on this Sub-agent and what information to provide.

### Message Template

Create a standardized format for requests sent to the Sub-agent:

```
Example: "Please research {{topic}} and focus on {{specific_aspect}}. The information will be used for {{purpose}}."
```

Variables like `{{topic}}` will be filled in by the parent Agent when making requests. This creates consistency and ensures all necessary context is included with each request.

## Task View Settings

### View Title

Name your custom dashboard view with a clear, descriptive title:

```
Examples: "Customer Support Interactions" or "Document Processing Tasks"
```

A good title helps you quickly identify and switch between different monitoring views.

### Information to Include

Select which tools or actions you want to track in this view:

* Search for specific tools (like "Send Email" or "Generate Report")
* Only tasks using these selected tools will appear in this view
* This filtering helps you focus on the specific workflows you need to monitor

**Pro tip:** Create separate views for different workflows to avoid information overload and make monitoring more efficient.

## Why Task Views Matter

Task Views help you organize and monitor complex Agent workflows by:
* Separating different types of work into focused dashboards
* Reducing noise from unrelated activities
* Making it easier to track progress on specific processes
* Allowing different team members to monitor the aspects most relevant to them
