### Language Model

**What it is:** The AI engine that powers your agent's thinking and communication.

**How to choose:**

- **Default model:** Best for most use cases - balanced performance and cost
- **Advanced models:** May offer improved reasoning but at higher cost
- **Specialized models:** Optimized for specific tasks like coding or creative writing

**Tip:** If you're just getting started, stick with the default model. You can always upgrade later as your needs evolve.

### Thinking

**What it is:** Adds a default 'thinking tool' to the agent. This tool allows agents to think during the conversation. Increases reasoning and planning capabilities.

### Temperature

**What it is:** A slider that controls how creative versus predictable your agent's responses will be.

**How to set it:**

- **Low (0-0.3):** More focused, consistent responses - ideal for factual tasks, customer support, or data analysis
- **Medium (0.4-0.7):** Balanced creativity and precision - good for general conversation
- **High (0.8-1.0):** More varied, creative responses - better for brainstorming, storytelling, or generating diverse ideas

**Example:** A sales agent might use lower temperature for explaining product specs, but higher temperature when brainstorming marketing ideas.
