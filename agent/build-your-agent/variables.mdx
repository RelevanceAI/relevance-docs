## Overview

Variables in Relevance AI allow you to store and reuse data across your agents, eliminating the need to repeatedly type the same information. They provide several key benefits:

- **Efficiency**: Define information once and use it multiple times
- **Consistency**: Ensure the same data is used throughout your workflows
- **Maintainability**: Update information in one place and have it reflect everywhere
- **Flexibility**: Use variables in both tools and prompts

Variables act as dynamic placeholders that can significantly streamline your agent development process and make your workflows more adaptable to changing requirements.

<Tip>Variables are particularly useful for information that might change over time, such as company details, product specifications, or process guidelines.</Tip>

## Configure Variables

The Configure tab allows you to set up and manage your variables:

1. **Name**: Create a descriptive name for your variable
2. **Description**: Add context about what the variable represents and how it should be used
3. **Input**: Enter the actual value of the variable
4. **Variable Name**: Define the reference name used to call this variable in your tools and prompts
5. **Data Type**: Specify what type of data the variable contains

## Set Values

The Set Values tab provides a streamlined interface for quickly updating your variable values:

- View all your variables in one place
- Modify values without changing other variable properties
- See immediate updates reflected across your agent

This tab offers the same functionality as the Configure tab but focuses specifically on changing variable values, making it ideal for quick updates when your underlying data changes.

<Tip>
Consider using variables for information like:

- Company contact details
- Product pricing
- Service descriptions
- API endpoints
- Frequently used instructions
