## What are Agents?

Agents are powered by LLMs that plan and complete tasks on autopilot. They are given tools, and decide how to use tools to achieve goals prompted by you.

## What are the benefits of an AI Agent?
<Steps>
  <Step title="Scales to meet demand">
    Agents can flex with your needs, handling seasonal or regional spikes in activity-especially useful in industries like education, hospitality, and finance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Increases engagement">
    Automate repetitive tasks so your team can focus on high-value work. Sales teams, for example, use agents to qualify leads, freeing reps to close deals.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Learns from experience">
    If an agent doesn’t know something, it can escalate to a human, store the answer, and use it next time. Ours posts unknowns to Slack for fast input and learning.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Works solo or with you">
    Agents can run fully autonomously or in co-pilot mode. One of ours builds Webflow pages daily—no human touch required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Responds flexibly">
    Unlike rule-based tools, agents adapt their responses to each task. A support agent might troubleshoot one day and resolve billing the next.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Where are they most useful?

AI agents excel in roles requiring consistent execution of complex but well-defined processes, such as:

- **Customer Support**: Handling routine inquiries, troubleshooting common issues, and escalating complex problems to human agents
- **Sales Qualification**: Engaging with prospects, gathering initial information, and identifying promising leads
- **Content Creation**: Generating drafts of routine documents, reports, and communications
- **Data Analysis**: Processing and summarizing large volumes of information to extract actionable insights
- **Scheduling and Coordination**: Managing calendars, setting up meetings, and sending reminders


## How to get the most from your AI Agents

When inventing or creating an agent, you'd want to utilize domain expertise or model an agent after a Domain expert::

1. **Start with clear objectives**: Define specific tasks and goals for your agents
2. **Provide quality knowledge bases**: Equip agents with comprehensive, up-to-date information
3. **Establish escalation protocols**: Create clear paths for agents to involve humans when needed
4. **Monitor and refine**: Regularly review agent performance and make adjustments
5. **Integrate with existing systems**: Connect agents to your current tools and workflows

By thoughtfully implementing AI agents, organizations can enhance productivity, improve customer experiences, and free human employees to focus on work that requires creativity, empathy, and strategic thinking.
