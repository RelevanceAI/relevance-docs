## What are Agents?

Agents are reasoning bots powered by LLMs that plan and complete tasks on autopilot. They are given tools, and decide how to use tools to achieve their goals and complete work.

## What are the benefits of an AI Agent?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Scales to meet demand">
    You can scale agents and multi-agent teams up and down to meet demand. Many of our customers experience seasonal fluctuations in demand, with some time periods or regions requiring more support than others (E.g. Education, hospitality and finance industries).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Increases engagement">
    You can use agents to automate repetitive time-consuming tasks, so that your human employees can be freed up to do more engaging work. Our sales customers love that they can spend more time on customer meetings and closing deals instead of spending so much time qualifying leads. Their BDR agent frees let them move most of there efforts further down the funnel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Learns from experience">
    If your agent cannot answer a question it has been asked by a customer, it can loop in a sales rep or a manager via your preferred communications tool (email, instant chat etc), and store the answer for future use. We send our "I don't know" escalation into a Slack channel. Anyone in our team can just click on the link in there, come into Relevance and give it an answer. Our agent will then rephrase that and answer our customer. You can also insert it into an FAQ knowledge base if you want.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Can work autonomously or on co-pilot">
    Agents on our platform can complete work end-to-end without you needing to be involved at all. For example, we have an agent that checks for new public tools that have been released on our platform every weekday at 9am, and then produces tool explainer webpages and uploads them to Webflow without needing our input at all. The best use-cases for autopilot agents are those that are low-risk (nothing terrible will happen if something goes wrong).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adaptive and non-deterministic">
    Agents do not have to respond to tasks in the exact same way ever time like traditional software solutions. They have the ability to choose the most appropriate way to respond on a case-by-case basis. E.g. A customer support agent might be asked to help a customer resolve a billing issue on one day, or to troubleshoot a technical bug on another day.
  </Step>
</Steps>



## Where are they most useful?

AI agents excel in roles requiring consistent execution of complex but well-defined processes, such as:

- **Customer Support**: Handling routine inquiries, troubleshooting common issues, and escalating complex problems to human agents
- **Sales Qualification**: Engaging with prospects, gathering initial information, and identifying promising leads
- **Content Creation**: Generating drafts of routine documents, reports, and communications
- **Data Analysis**: Processing and summarizing large volumes of information to extract actionable insights
- **Scheduling and Coordination**: Managing calendars, setting up meetings, and sending reminders


## How to get the most from your AI Agents

When inventing or creating an agent, you'd want to utilize domain expertise or model an agent after a Domain expert::


1. **Start with clear objectives**: Define specific tasks and goals for your agents
2. **Provide quality knowledge bases**: Equip agents with comprehensive, up-to-date information
3. **Establish escalation protocols**: Create clear paths for agents to involve humans when needed
4. **Monitor and refine**: Regularly review agent performance and make adjustments
5. **Integrate with existing systems**: Connect agents to your current tools and workflows

By thoughtfully implementing AI agents, organizations can enhance productivity, improve customer experiences, and free human employees to focus on work that requires creativity, empathy, and strategic thinking.
