## Do I need coding knowledge to Invent an Agent?

No, Invent is specifically designed to make agent creation accessible to users without technical expertise. You only need to describe what you want your agent to do in plain English.

## What are tools in the context of AI agents?

Tools are capabilities that agents can use to perform specific actions and complete tasks. They extend what an agent can do beyond just conversation. For example, an agent might use tools to:
- Search the internet for information
- Access and update customer records in a CRM
- Send emails or messages
- Schedule appointments
- Generate content or analyze data

Relevance AI provides both pre-built tool templates and the ability to create custom tools for your agents.

## How does Knowledge for Agents work?

Knowledge in Relevance AI refers to the information and context provided to agents to help them perform their tasks effectively. This is often implemented through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which allows agents to access and use specific information sources when responding to queries or completing tasks.

By giving agents access to knowledge bases, you can ensure they provide accurate, up-to-date information specific to your business, products, or services.

## What is a Multi Agent System (MAS)?

Yes, Relevance AI supports creating multi-agent systems where specialized AI agents work together to accomplish complex tasks. This is part of the AI Workforce feature, which provides a visual canvas where you can design, connect, and monitor teams of specialized agents.

## How do agents handle situations they can't resolve?

Agents can be configured to escalate issues they can't handle to human team members. For example, if an agent cannot answer a customer's question, it can loop in a sales rep or manager via your preferred communication tool (email, chat, etc.). The human can provide an answer, which the agent can then use to respond to the customer and store for future reference.

## What integrations are available for AI agents?

Relevance AI offers numerous integrations that allow agents to connect with external tools and services, including:

- Email platforms (Gmail, Outlook)
- CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Messaging platforms (Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram)
- Productivity tools (Google Calendar, Google Sheets)
- Knowledge management systems (Notion, Confluence)
- And many more

These integrations enable agents to access data and perform actions across your entire tech stack.


## Can agents operate autonomously without human oversight?

Yes, agents on the Relevance AI platform can complete work end-to-end without human involvement. For example, you could create an agent that checks for new information daily and produces reports or updates websites automatically.

However, you can also configure agents to work in a co-pilot mode, where they assist humans rather than working completely independently. The best approach depends on your specific use case and comfort level with automation.

## What are the system limits or quotas for AI agents?

Relevance AI has system quotas that define the maximum resource allocations for different aspects of the platform. These may include limits on the number of agents, conversations, knowledge bases, or API calls depending on your plan. Specific details about these quotas can be found in the system quotas documentation.

## How do I monitor and improve my agents' performance?

Relevance AI provides tools to monitor your agents' performance, including:

1. **Task View**: A centralized interface for monitoring, managing, and interacting with your AI workforce
2. **Conversation History**: Review past interactions to identify areas for improvement
3. **Analytics**: Track metrics related to agent usage and effectiveness
