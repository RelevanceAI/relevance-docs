## Overview

Easily share your AI agent with others by choosing how they can interact with it. Whether you want to send a live chat link, embed a support widget, showcase tasks in an iframe, or allow full template cloning, you have flexible options to fit any use case.

You can also duplicate or clone agents for yourself to create variations, test changes, or move agents between projects.

---

## Duplicate or Clone Your Agent

Want to create a copy of your agent? You can duplicate agents using two methods:

### Copy to Project (Recommended)

The fastest way to duplicate an agent is using the **"Copy to Project"** feature. This method creates a complete copy of your agent in just a few clicks.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your Agents list">
    Navigate to your Agents page in the Relevance AI platform
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the agent you want to duplicate">
    Locate the agent you want to copy in your agents list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the agent menu">
    Click the three-dot menu (⋮) next to the agent name
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Copy to Project">
    Choose "Copy to Project" from the dropdown menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose destination">
    Select the destination project (can be the same project or a different one)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete the copy">
    Click "Copy" to create your duplicate agent
  </Step>
</Steps>

- **Creating variations**: Build similar agents with slight modifications for different purposes
- **Testing changes**: Create a test version without affecting your production agent
- **Moving between projects**: Transfer agents between different projects or organizations (if you have access to multiple)
- **Backing up configurations**: Keep backup copies of important agents before making changes

### Using Clonable Templates

You can also duplicate your own agents using the clonable template feature described in the [Clonable Template](#clonable-template) section below. This method is useful when you want to share the agent with others AND keep copies for yourself, or when you need to share agents across different workspaces.

<Tip>
**Which method should you use?**
- Use **Copy to Project** for quick duplication within your workspace or between projects you have access to
- Use **Clonable Templates** when you want to share with external users or create a public template that can be cloned multiple times

## Sharing Your Agent with Others

The following methods allow you to share your agent with other users, either for them to interact with or to clone into their own workspace.

## Chat UI

Let others interact with your Agent through a clean, conversation-style interface — just like a chatbot. You can share it via a link or embed it as an iframe. This is perfect for letting people experience your Agent without modifying anything. All usage is billed to your account, and others can use the Agent without needing to set it up themselves.

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cma28o7c025yi13m0vky5wvrg?embed_v=2" frameBorder="0" title="Relevanceai Demo" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />

</div>

#### Developer Notes

<Note>
  The `iframe` inherits `100%` of its parent container by default. Configure your container's dimensions carefully to ensure the iframe displays correctly within your page layout without causing layout issues.
</Note>

## Chat Widget

Turn your Agent into a pop-up chat interface you can embed on any website with a simple script tag. It behaves like a support chat window and is ideal for customer-facing use cases like answering questions, handling requests, or collecting feedback directly on your site.

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cma29ej0x26k313m03yp169lg?embed_v=2" frameBorder="0" title="Relevanceai Demo" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />

</div>

#### Developer Notes

<Note>
  Target the `.relevanceai-chat-bubble-app` class to style the chat bubble. Adjust its `z-index` property to position the bubble above or below other UI elements such as cookie popups and toast messages.

## Task UI

This gives users access to a task-focused version of your Agent via an iframe. Users can view past task runs, pick from existing tasks, and even interact with outputs — all within a self-contained UI. It's great for operational dashboards, workflow demos, or giving others visibility into what your Agent is doing.

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cma29kkqd26vk13m0oed5ldml?embed_v=2" frameBorder="0" title="Relevanceai Demo" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />

</div>

## Clonable Template

Let others clone your Agent - complete with its instructions and setup - into their own workspace. This makes it easy to share best practices, pre-built use cases, or workflows without needing to rebuild from scratch. Cloned agents use the recipient's credits, not yours, making this perfect for scalable distribution.

<Tip>
**Duplicate your own agent:** You can use the clone link yourself to create a copy of your own agent. This is useful for creating variations, sharing across different workspaces, or when you want to create a template that can be cloned multiple times. For a faster method within the same workspace, use [Copy to Project](#copy-to-project-recommended) instead.
