## Overview

Easily share your AI agent with others by choosing how they can interact with it. Whether you want to send a live chat link, embed a support widget, showcase tasks in an iframe, or allow full template cloning, you have flexible options to fit any use case.

## Clonable Template

Let others clone your Agent - complete with its instructions and setup - into their own workspace. This makes it easy to share best practices, pre-built use cases, or workflows without needing to rebuild from scratch. Cloned agents use the recipient's credits, not yours, making this perfect for scalable distribution.

<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cma29kkqd26vk13m0oed5ldml?embed_v=2" frameBorder="0" title="Relevanceai Demo" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />

</div>

## Copy to Project

Want to create a copy of your agent for yourself? Use the "Copy to Project" feature to duplicate agents quickly between different projects. This preserves all agent configurations, settings, and instructions.

</div>

## Chat UI

Let others interact with your Agent through a clean, conversation-style interface — just like a chatbot. You can share it via a link or embed it as an iframe. This is perfect for letting people experience your Agent without modifying anything. All usage is billed to your account, and others can use the Agent without needing to set it up themselves.

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cma28o7c025yi13m0vky5wvrg?embed_v=2" frameBorder="0" title="Relevanceai Demo" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />

</div>

#### Developer Notes

<Note>
  The `iframe` inherits `100%` of its parent container by default. Configure your container's dimensions carefully to ensure the iframe displays correctly within your page layout without causing layout issues.
</Note>

## Chat Widget

Turn your Agent into a pop-up chat interface you can embed on any website with a simple script tag. It behaves like a support chat window and is ideal for customer-facing use cases like answering questions, handling requests, or collecting feedback directly on your site.

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cma29ej0x26k313m03yp169lg?embed_v=2" frameBorder="0" title="Relevanceai Demo" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />

</div>

<Warning>
  **User Level Authentication is not supported in embedded chat widgets.** If your agent uses [User Level Authentication](/integrations/dynamic-auth) (an Enterprise feature that allows each user to authenticate with their own credentials), this will not work in embedded chat widgets. For embedded agents, you'll need to configure your agent to use a shared account for integrations instead.
</Warning>

#### Developer Notes

<Note>
  Target the `.relevanceai-chat-bubble-app` class to style the chat bubble. Adjust its `z-index` property to position the bubble above or below other UI elements such as cookie popups and toast messages.

## Task UI

This gives users access to a task-focused version of your Agent via an iframe. Users can view past task runs, pick from existing tasks, and even interact with outputs — all within a self-contained UI. It's great for operational dashboards, workflow demos, or giving others visibility into what your Agent is doing.

## SDK

For developers who want full control over the user experience, you can build custom agent integrations directly into your website or application using our JavaScript/TypeScript SDK. 

The SDK gives you complete flexibility to:
- Design custom chat interfaces that perfectly match your brand
- Build unique user experiences beyond what the standard embeds offer
- Integrate agent capabilities into existing applications
- Handle real-time messaging and task management programmatically

The SDK works seamlessly with modern frameworks and runtimes including React, Vue, Node.js, Deno, Bun, and Cloudflare Workers. You can use AI-powered coding tools like Cursor to help you build your integration quickly.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I clone an agent that I originally cloned from the Marketplace?">
    Some Relevance Builders have chosen to restrict cloning of agents that originated from their Marketplace listings. This prevents users from redistributing paid listings to avoid payment and protects the builder's intellectual property.
    
    If you need another copy of the agent, you can return to the [Marketplace](/marketplace/intro-to-marketplace) and clone the original listing again or add it to other projects directly from there.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why can't I use Copy to Project on an agent I cloned from the Marketplace?">
    Some Relevance Builders have chosen to restrict copying of agents that originated from their Marketplace listings. The Copy to Project feature is disabled for these agents to prevent users from redistributing paid listings without proper authorization and to protect the builder's intellectual property.
    
    To add the agent to additional projects, visit the [Marketplace](/marketplace/intro-to-marketplace) and clone the original listing directly to each project where you need it.
