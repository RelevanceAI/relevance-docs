This guide gets you from zero to a working agent as fast as possible. Pick one of three paths, follow the steps, and see your agent in action.

These steps assume you're logged in and on the home screen. If you don't have an account yet, [sign up for free](https://auth.relevanceai.com/signup/).

## Step 1: Create your first agent

There are three ways to get started. Pick the one that fits you best.

### Option 1: Invent an Agent

The fastest way to get started. Describe what you need and we'll generate a working agent for you.

1. Click **Agents** in the left sidebar
2. Click **+ Create Agent**
3. Select **Invent**
4. Describe what you want your agent to do — be specific about the task, the output you expect, and any integrations it should use. For example: *"Create an agent that researches a company before a sales call. It should use web search to find recent news, funding, and key contacts, then output a one-page brief with company overview, decision makers, and talking points."*
5. Review the generated agent — Inventor will set up the prompt and suggest tools
6. Connect any integrations your tools need (e.g. Gmail, HubSpot, LinkedIn) in the Tools section of the Agent builder, or [add integrations](/integrations/add-integrations) from the sidebar

<Tip>
Best when you know what you want and can describe it clearly. Great for getting a concept off the ground quickly — Inventor handles the setup, you make the tweaks.
</Tip>

### Option 2: Clone from Marketplace

Start with an agent that's already been built and tested by domain experts.

1. Go to [Marketplace](https://marketplace.relevanceai.com/) or click **Marketplace** in the left sidebar
2. Browse or search for an agent that matches your use case
3. Click on the agent to view its details
4. Click **Clone** to add it to your workspace
5. A setup popup will walk you through connecting any integrations the agent needs — follow the prompts to link your accounts
6. Review the prompt, tools, and settings — adjust anything you need

<Tip>
Great when you have a common use case — like lead qualification, meeting prep, or customer support — and want a proven starting point. Clone it, tweak it, ship it.
</Tip>

### Option 3: Build from Scratch

Full control from the ground up. Best if you have a specific workflow in mind.

1. Click **Agents** in the left sidebar
2. Click **+ Create Agent**
3. Select **Start from scratch**
4. Write a [prompt](/agent/build-your-agent/prompt) — tell the agent who it is, what it does, and how it should behave
5. Add [tools](/agent/build-your-agent/tools) — give it the actions it needs (search the web, send emails, update your CRM, etc.)
6. Optionally add [knowledge](/knowledge/create-knowledge) — upload docs or connect data sources for context

For a full breakdown of building with Relevance AI, see [Build with Relevance AI](/build/introduction).

## Step 2: Test your agent

Head to the **Run** tab to give your agent a task. This is a real run — you can see exactly what tools it calls, what output it produces, and how it handles the task end-to-end.

## Step 3: Refine

If the output isn't quite right, iterate:

- **Tighten the prompt** — be more specific about what you want, how it should be formatted, and what tone to use
- **Add or adjust tools** — make sure the agent has access to the right actions for the job
- **Add knowledge** — upload docs, connect data sources, or add context so the agent has what it needs

Test again after each change. A few rounds of this and you'll have a solid agent.

## Step 4: Share and deploy

Once you're happy with the output, put your agent to work:

- [Share your agent](/agent/share-your-agent) with your team so others can use it
- Set up [triggers](/agent/build-your-agent/triggers) to run it automatically — on a schedule, from a webhook, or when something happens in your CRM
- Use [bulk schedule](/agent/give-your-agent-tasks/bulk-schedule) to run it across a list of inputs
- Add [escalations](/agent/build-your-agent/escalations) so the agent knows when to loop in a human
