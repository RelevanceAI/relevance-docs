### Invent an Agent

Use our Agent Invent feature to instantly create a functional agent. Just describe what you want in plain English, and we'll generate a working draft with a prompt and tool placeholders ready for you to customize.

**Best for:** Getting started quickly with minimal setup

**How it works:**
1. Describe your agent's purpose and tasks
2. Our AI generates the initial configuration
3. Review and customize the generated agent
4. Deploy and start using it

<Tip>
  This is the fastest way to get up and running. We highly recommend starting here if you're new to building agents.

1. Browse the [Marketplace](/get-started/marketplace) for agents that match your use case
2. Clone the agent to your workspace
3. Customize the configuration to your needs

### Build from Scratch

Start from scratch and build your agent fully customized to your workflows. This approach gives you complete control over every aspect of your agent's design and behavior.

**Best for:** Advanced users who need full customization

**How it works:**
1. Define your agent's purpose and goals
2. Configure the prompt and instructions
3. Add tools and integrations
4. Set up knowledge bases
5. Configure escalation and approval workflows
6. Test and deploy
