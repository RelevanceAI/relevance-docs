This guide gets you from zero to a working agent as fast as possible. Pick one of three paths, follow the steps, and see your agent in action.

## Step 1: Create your first agent

There are three ways to get started. Pick the one that fits you best.

### Option 1: Invent an Agent

The fastest way to get started. Describe what you need and we'll generate a working agent for you.

1. Click **Agents** in the left sidebar
2. Click **+ Create Agent**
3. Select **Invent**
4. Describe what you want your agent to do — be specific about the task, the output you expect, and any integrations it should use. For example: *"Create an agent that researches a company before a sales call. It should use web search to find recent news, funding, and key contacts, then output a one-page brief with company overview, decision makers, and talking points."*
5. Review the generated agent — Inventor will set up the prompt and suggest tools
6. Connect any integrations your tools need (e.g. Gmail, HubSpot, LinkedIn) in the Tools section of the Agent builder, or [add integrations](/integrations/add-integrations) from the sidebar

<Tip>
This is the best starting point if you're new. You can always refine the prompt and add more tools later.
</Tip>

### Option 2: Clone from Marketplace

Start with an agent that's already been built and tested by domain experts.

1. Go to [Marketplace](https://marketplace.relevanceai.com/) or click **Marketplace** in the left sidebar
2. Browse or search for an agent that matches your use case
3. Click on the agent to view its details
4. Click **Clone** to add it to your workspace
5. A setup popup will walk you through connecting any integrations the agent needs — follow the prompts to link your accounts
6. Review the prompt, tools, and settings — adjust anything you need

<Tip>
Great when you know what you want to build but don't want to start from scratch. Clone it, tweak it, ship it.
</Tip>

### Option 3: Build from Scratch

Full control from the ground up. Best if you have a specific workflow in mind.

1. Click **Agents** in the left sidebar
2. Click **+ Create Agent**
3. Select **Start from scratch**
4. Write a [prompt](/agent/build-your-agent/prompt) — tell the agent who it is, what it does, and how it should behave
5. Add [tools](/agent/build-your-agent/tools) — give it the actions it needs (search the web, send emails, update your CRM, etc.)
6. Optionally add [knowledge](/knowledge/create-knowledge) — upload docs or connect data sources for context

For a full walkthrough of every setting, see [Build with Relevance AI](/build/introduction).

## Step 2: Test your agent

There are two ways to test:

- **Quick test** — click **Test agent** under the agent name in the Prompt tab. This opens a chat window where you can give the agent a task and see how it responds, what tools it calls, and what output it produces. Great for rapid iteration while you're still building.
- **Full test** — head to the **Run** tab to give your agent a proper end-to-end run. This simulates a real task in the same environment your agent will actually operate in, so you can see exactly how it behaves in production.

Start with a quick test to make sure the basics work, then move to the Run tab to validate with real inputs before sharing.

## Step 3: Refine

If the output isn't quite right, iterate:

- **Tighten the prompt** — be more specific about what you want, how it should be formatted, and what tone to use
- **Add or adjust tools** — make sure the agent has access to the right actions for the job
- **Add knowledge** — upload docs, connect data sources, or add context so the agent has what it needs

Test again after each change. A few rounds of this and you'll have a solid agent.

## Step 4: Share and deploy

Once you're happy with the output, put your agent to work:

- [Share your agent](/agent/share-your-agent) with your team so others can use it
- Set up [triggers](/agent/build-your-agent/triggers) to run it automatically — on a schedule, from a webhook, or when something happens in your CRM
- Use [bulk schedule](/agent/give-your-agent-tasks/bulk-schedule) to run it across a list of inputs
- Add [escalations](/agent/build-your-agent/escalations) so the agent knows when to loop in a human
