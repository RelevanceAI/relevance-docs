## How It Works

1. **Receive request**: "Schedule 30 minutes with John next week"
2. **Check availability**: Query participant calendars across timezones
3. **Propose options**: Find optimal times, suggest 2-3 options
4. **Create meeting**: Send invitations with video conference link

## Prerequisites

- Calendar integration (Google Calendar or Outlook) with read/write access
- Email integration (Gmail or Outlook) to receive scheduling requests

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Agent">
    Create a new agent named "Meeting Scheduler" or "Demo Scheduler"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Calendar and Email">
    **For Google:**
    1. Go to **Integrations**
    2. Add **Google (Gmail, Calendar, Docs, & API)**
    3. Grant calendar and email permissions
    
    **For Microsoft:**
    1. Add **Microsoft 365** integration
    2. Grant calendar and email permissions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Email Trigger">
    1. Go to **Triggers** → **+ Add Trigger**
    2. Select your email integration
    3. Configure keyword matching (e.g., `"demo"` to detect demo requests)
    
    Your agent triggers when emails containing that keyword arrive.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Calendar Tools">
    Add these tools:
    - Check Calendar Availability
    - Create Calendar Event
    - Send Calendar Invitation
    - Add Video Conference Link
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Prompt">
    ```
    You are a meeting scheduler. When asked to schedule:
    1. Extract: participants, duration, timeframe, preferences
    2. Check everyone's availability
    3. Propose 2-3 times that work (respect timezones, working hours)
    4. Once confirmed, create event with video link and invitations
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test">
    Send an email with your keyword (e.g., "demo") or message your agent:
    ```
    Schedule 30 minutes with [colleague] tomorrow
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Marketplace Example: Calendar Bookings Scheduler

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/agent-scheduler.png" alt="Calendar Bookings Scheduler agent" />
</Frame>

A pre-built agent from the [Relevance AI Marketplace](https://relevanceai.com/agent-templates-tasks/meeting-auto-scheduling) that handles inbound demo requests.

**How It Works:**
1. Monitors emails for demo requests
2. Checks calendar for available 30-minute slots
3. Proposes 3 times per day across 2 different days
4. Sends professional email with options
5. Books confirmed time and sends invitation

**Example Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

I've checked our calendar and have these times available:

• Wednesday, Jan 22 at 10:00am, 2:00pm or 4:00pm
• Friday, Jan 24 at 9:00am, 1:00pm or 3:00pm

Let me know which works best.

Cal
```

## Example Prompt

"Create a Legal Scheduling Coordinator agent that manages multi-district litigation (MDL) deposition schedules using Microsoft Outlook and LawConnect. Monitor incoming deposition requests, cross-reference attorney availability across jurisdictions, and automatically schedule parallel depositions while avoiding conflicts. When scheduling, allocate 4-hour blocks for each deposition, add 1-hour buffer times between sessions, and ensure no attorney is double-booked across jurisdictions. Set up automatic notifications 48 hours before each deposition with location details and participant list. If any attorney becomes unavailable, immediately identify alternative time slots within the next 5 business days and trigger rescheduling notifications to all affected parties."

**Customize this example:** Use our [Invent feature](/agent/build-your-agent/build-overview) to adapt this use case to your needs or add your own branded calendar integration.
