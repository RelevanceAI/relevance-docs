Meeting Auto-Scheduling Agents are digital teammates that actively negotiate optimal meeting times by understanding context, preferences, and priorities. They process thousands of scheduling permutations in seconds while coordinating across teams, time zones, and calendars. No more back-and-forth emails.

## Setup

### Critical Triggers for Meeting Scheduling Agents

To enable your scheduling agent, you'll need two essential integrations: a calendar provider with read/write access (such as Google Calendar or Outlook) to check availability and create events, and an email provider (like Gmail or Outlook) to receive and respond to scheduling requests. Configure these triggers so your agent can automatically detect scheduling requests and coordinate meetings across your team.

**Configure your two essential triggers**

## Marketplace Example: Calendar Bookings Scheduler

**How It Works:**
1. Monitors emails for demo requests
2. Checks calendar for available 30-minute slots
3. Proposes 3 times per day across 2 different days
4. Sends professional email with options
5. Books confirmed time and sends invitation

**Example Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

I've checked our calendar and have these times available:

• Wednesday, Jan 22 at 10:00am, 2:00pm or 4:00pm
• Friday, Jan 24 at 9:00am, 1:00pm or 3:00pm

Let me know which works best.

Cal
```

## Example Prompt

"Create a Legal Scheduling Coordinator agent that manages multi-district litigation (MDL) deposition schedules using Microsoft Outlook and LawConnect. Monitor incoming deposition requests, cross-reference attorney availability across jurisdictions, and automatically schedule parallel depositions while avoiding conflicts. When scheduling, allocate 4-hour blocks for each deposition, add 1-hour buffer times between sessions, and ensure no attorney is double-booked across jurisdictions. Set up automatic notifications 48 hours before each deposition with location details and participant list. If any attorney becomes unavailable, immediately identify alternative time slots within the next 5 business days and trigger rescheduling notifications to all affected parties."
