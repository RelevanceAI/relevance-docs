## Key Features

- **Understand natural language**: "Schedule with Sarah tomorrow afternoon"
- **Learn preferences**: Adapt to individual and team scheduling patterns over time
- **Manage buffer time**: Automatically add breaks between back-to-back meetings
- **Prioritize intelligently**: Respect organizational hierarchy and meeting importance
- **Resolve conflicts**: Automatically find alternatives when schedules clash
- **Coordinate multi-participant meetings**: Find optimal times across different time zones and working hours

## How It Works

1. **Receive request**: "Schedule 30 minutes with John next week"
2. **Check availability**: Query participant calendars across timezones
3. **Propose options**: Find optimal times, suggest 2-3 options
4. **Create meeting**: Send invitations with video conference link

## Prerequisites

- Calendar integration (Google Calendar or Outlook) with read/write access
- Email integration (Gmail or Outlook) to receive scheduling requests

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Agent">
    Create a new agent named "Meeting Scheduler" or "Demo Scheduler"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Calendar and Email">
    **For Google:**
    1. Go to **Integrations**
    2. Add **Google (Gmail, Calendar, Docs, & API)**
    3. Grant calendar and email permissions
    
    **For Microsoft:**
    1. Add **Microsoft 365** integration
    2. Grant calendar and email permissions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Email Trigger">
    1. Go to **Triggers** → **+ Add Trigger**
    2. Select your email integration
    3. Configure keyword matching (e.g., `"demo"` to detect demo requests)
    
    Your agent triggers when emails containing that keyword arrive.

    - Check Calendar Availability
    - Create Calendar Event
    - Send Calendar Invitation
    - Add Video Conference Link
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Prompt">
    ```
    You are a meeting scheduler. When asked to schedule:
    1. Extract: participants, duration, timeframe, preferences
    2. Check everyone's availability
    3. Propose 2-3 times that work (respect timezones, working hours)
    4. Once confirmed, create event with video link and invitations
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test">
    Send an email with your keyword (e.g., "demo") or message your agent:
    ```
    Schedule 30 minutes with [colleague] tomorrow
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
