Meeting Auto-Scheduling Agents are digital teammates that actively negotiate optimal meeting times by understanding context, preferences, and priorities.

## How to Setup

### Triggers for Meeting Scheduling Agents

<Note>
This example shows tools for Google Calendar. You'll need to follow the same steps if you are using a different calendar provider (Outlook, Apple Calendar, etc.).
</Note>

**Configure your two essential triggers**

<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmkewuh3y0dv9w7p2l515yatk" 
  frameBorder="0" 
  title="Meeting Scheduler Triggers Setup" 
  allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" 
  webkitAllowFullscreen="true" 
  mozAllowFullscreen="true" 
  allowFullscreen 
  style={{ position:"relative",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"400px",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />

To enable your scheduling agent, you'll need two essential integrations:

- **Calendar provider** (Google Calendar or Outlook) with read/write access to check availability and create events
- **Email trigger** (Gmail or Outlook) to monitor your inbox and kick off the agent when scheduling requests arrive

Configure these triggers so your agent can automatically detect scheduling requests and coordinate meetings across your team.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Get Events from Google Calendar" icon="list">
