## Setup

### Critical Triggers for Meeting Scheduling Agents

To enable your scheduling agent, you'll need two essential integrations: a calendar provider with read/write access (such as Google Calendar or Outlook) to check availability and create events, and an email trigger (Gmail or Outlook) to monitor your inbox and kick off the agent when scheduling requests arrive. Configure these triggers so your agent can automatically detect scheduling requests and coordinate meetings across your team.

**Configure your two essential triggers**

### Add Calendar Tools to Your Agent

Your scheduling agent needs specific tools to interact with calendars. Search for your calendar provider in the tool library to add these capabilities.

<Accordion title="Example: Building a Demo Scheduler">
If you're creating an agent that schedules product demos, add these tools:

1. **Check Google calendar availability** - Find open slots in your sales team's calendars
2. **Send Email (Gmail)** - Reply with available time options to prospects
3. **Create Meet Event in Google Calendar** - Automatically generate video links for each demo
4. **Get Events from Google Calendar** - Avoid double-booking or scheduling too many demos in one day

Your agent will use these tools to coordinate demo requests, propose available times, and create meetings with video links in one flow.

## Marketplace Example: Calendar Bookings Scheduler

<Frame>

</Frame>

**How It Works:**
1. Monitors emails for demo requests
2. Checks calendar for available 30-minute slots
3. Proposes 3 times per day across 2 different days
4. Sends professional email with options
5. Books confirmed time and sends invitation

**Example Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

I've checked our calendar and have these times available:

• Wednesday, Jan 22 at 10:00am, 2:00pm or 4:00pm
• Friday, Jan 24 at 9:00am, 1:00pm or 3:00pm

Let me know which works best.

Cal
```

## Example Prompt

"Create a Legal Scheduling Coordinator agent that manages multi-district litigation (MDL) deposition schedules using Microsoft Outlook and LawConnect. Monitor incoming deposition requests, cross-reference attorney availability across jurisdictions, and automatically schedule parallel depositions while avoiding conflicts. When scheduling, allocate 4-hour blocks for each deposition, add 1-hour buffer times between sessions, and ensure no attorney is double-booked across jurisdictions. Set up automatic notifications 48 hours before each deposition with location details and participant list. If any attorney becomes unavailable, immediately identify alternative time slots within the next 5 business days and trigger rescheduling notifications to all affected parties."

**Customize this example:** Use our [Invent feature](/agent/quick-start-guide#invent-an-agent) to adapt this use case to your needs or add your own branded calendar integration.
