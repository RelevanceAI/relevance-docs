A Meeting Scheduling Agent coordinates meeting times, handles timezones, resolves conflicts, and creates calendar invitations. No more back-and-forth emails.

## How It Works

1. **Receive request** - "Schedule 30 minutes with John next week"
2. **Check availability** - Query participant calendars across timezones
3. **Propose options** - Find optimal times, suggest 2-3 options
4. **Create meeting** - Send invitations with video conference link

## Prerequisites

- Calendar integration (Google Calendar or Outlook) with read/write access
- Email integration (Gmail or Outlook) to receive scheduling requests

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Agent">
    Create a new agent named "Meeting Scheduler" or "Demo Scheduler"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Calendar and Email">
    **For Google:**
    1. Go to **Integrations**
    2. Add **Google (Gmail, Calendar, Docs, & API)**
    3. Grant calendar and email permissions
    
    **For Microsoft:**
    1. Add **Microsoft 365** integration
    2. Grant calendar and email permissions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Email Trigger">
    1. Go to **Triggers** → **+ Add Trigger**
    2. Select your email integration
    3. Configure keyword matching (e.g., `"demo"` to detect demo requests)
    
    Your agent triggers when emails containing that keyword arrive.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Calendar Tools">
    Add these tools:
    - Check Calendar Availability
    - Create Calendar Event
    - Send Calendar Invitation
    - Add Video Conference Link
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Prompt">
    ```
    You are a meeting scheduler. When asked to schedule:
    1. Extract: participants, duration, timeframe, preferences
    2. Check everyone's availability
    3. Propose 2-3 times that work (respect timezones, working hours)
    4. Once confirmed, create event with video link and invitations
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test">
    Send an email with your keyword (e.g., "demo") or message your agent:
    ```
    Schedule 30 minutes with [colleague] tomorrow
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

A pre-built agent from the [Relevance AI Marketplace](https://relevanceai.com/agent-templates-tasks/meeting-auto-scheduling) that handles inbound demo requests.

**How It Works:**
1. Monitors emails for demo requests
2. Checks calendar for available 30-minute slots
3. Proposes 3 times per day across 2 different days
4. Sends professional email with options
5. Books confirmed time and sends invitation

**Example Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

I've checked our calendar and have these times available:

• Wednesday, Jan 22 at 10:00am, 2:00pm or 4:00pm
• Friday, Jan 24 at 9:00am, 1:00pm or 3:00pm

Let me know which works best.

Cal
