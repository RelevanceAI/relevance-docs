## Overview

A Meeting Auto-Scheduling Agent coordinates meeting times across multiple participants, handles timezone differences, resolves conflicts, and optimizes scheduling based on preferences—eliminating the back-and-forth of manual scheduling.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receive Scheduling Request">
    The agent receives a request to schedule a meeting with specific participants and requirements
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Availability">
    Queries calendar integrations to find available time slots for all participants
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Optimize & Propose">
    Analyzes options considering timezones, preferences, and priorities, then proposes optimal times
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm & Create">
    Once confirmed, creates the calendar event and sends invitations to all participants
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up Your Scheduling Agent

### Prerequisites

<CardGroup cols={2}>

    Required for calendar access and event creation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Outlook (Optional)" icon="envelope" href="/integrations/popular-integrations/outlook">
    For Microsoft 365 calendar integration
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Step 1: Connect Calendar Integration

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Google Calendar">
    1. Navigate to **Integrations & API Keys**
    2. Find and click on "Google Calendar"
    3. Click "Connect" and authenticate
    4. Grant **calendar-read-write** permissions

  </Card>
  <Card title="Build Custom" icon="hammer">
    Create a new agent with calendar tools
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Step 3: Configure Scheduling Rules

Define your scheduling preferences and constraints:

```json
{
  "working_hours": {
    "start": "09:00",
    "end": "17:00",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  },
  "buffer_time": "15 minutes",
  "preferred_days": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday"],
  "avoid_times": ["12:00-13:00"],
  "meeting_duration_default": "30 minutes"
}
```

## Triggering Your Scheduling Agent

### Email Trigger

Set up email monitoring to respond to scheduling requests:

1. Connect your email integration (Gmail or Outlook)
2. Configure the agent to monitor for scheduling keywords
3. Agent automatically responds with available times

**Example email trigger:**
```
Subject: Schedule a meeting
Body: "Can we schedule a 30-minute call next week to discuss the project?"
```

### Slack Trigger

Respond to scheduling requests in Slack:

1. Connect Slack integration
2. Mention the agent in channels or DMs
3. Agent proposes times and creates events

**Example Slack message:**
```
@scheduler Can you find a time for me and @john to meet for 1 hour this week?
```

### API Trigger

Programmatically trigger scheduling via API:

```javascript
{
  "participants": ["john@company.com", "sarah@company.com"],
  "duration": "60 minutes",
  "subject": "Project Kickoff",
  "timeframe": "next 7 days",
  "preferences": {
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
    "preferred_times": "morning"
  }
}
```

## Scheduling Workflows

### Basic Meeting Scheduling

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Received">
    Agent receives scheduling request with participants and requirements
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Availability Check">
    Queries all participants' calendars for available slots
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Propose Times">
    Suggests 3-5 optimal time slots considering all constraints
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    Once a time is selected, creates calendar event and sends invitations
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Handling Conflicts

When scheduling conflicts arise:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Automatic Conflict Detection" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    The agent identifies conflicts by:
    - Checking existing calendar events
    - Detecting overlapping meetings
    - Identifying out-of-office periods
    - Recognizing blocked time slots
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Intelligent Rescheduling" icon="calendar-arrow-up">
    When conflicts occur, the agent:
    - Proposes alternative times
    - Considers meeting priority levels
    - Suggests rescheduling lower-priority meetings
    - Notifies affected participants
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Escalation to Humans" icon="user">
    For complex conflicts, the agent:
    - Escalates to meeting organizer
    - Provides conflict details and options
    - Awaits human decision
    - Executes the chosen resolution
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Multi-Timezone Scheduling

For global teams, the agent handles timezone complexity:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Detect Timezones">
    Identifies each participant's timezone from their calendar settings
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Find Overlap">
    Calculates working hours overlap across all timezones
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Optimize Fairness">
    Rotates meeting times to avoid always favoring one timezone
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clear Communication">
    Sends invitations with times in each participant's local timezone
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example:**
```
Meeting scheduled for:
- 9:00 AM PST (Los Angeles)
- 12:00 PM EST (New York)
- 5:00 PM GMT (London)
- 1:00 AM +8 (Singapore - next day)
```

## Advanced Features

### Preference Learning

Your scheduling agent learns from past behavior:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Time Preferences" icon="clock">
    Learns preferred meeting times (e.g., mornings vs afternoons)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Buffer Periods" icon="arrows-left-right">
    Identifies preferred gaps between meetings
  </Card>
  <Card title="Meeting Patterns" icon="chart-line">
    Recognizes recurring meeting patterns and preferences
  </Card>
  <Card title="Participant Preferences" icon="users">
    Remembers preferences for specific participants or meeting types
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Smart Scheduling Rules

Configure intelligent scheduling logic:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Priority-Based">
    Assign priority levels to different meeting types:
    - **High**: Executive meetings, customer calls

    Higher priority meetings get first choice of time slots.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Duration-Based">
    Optimize scheduling based on meeting length:
    - Short meetings (15-30 min): Fill gaps between longer meetings

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Participant-Based">
    Apply rules based on who's attending:
    - VIP participants: Prioritize their availability
    - Large groups: Find times that work for majority
