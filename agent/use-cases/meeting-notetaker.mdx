A Meeting Notetaker Agent joins your meetings, records conversations, and generates summaries with action items.

## Prerequisites

- Calendar integration (Google Calendar or Outlook)
- "Relevance Meeting Bot" trigger added to your agent
- "Send Meeting Bot" tool added to your agent
- Distribution channel (Slack, email, etc.) - optional

## Setup

<div style={{ position:"relative",paddingBottom:"56.25%",height:0 }}>
  <iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmkdjwr5c0gx9qm44i9w77ftm" frameBorder="0" title="Setting up Meeting Notetaker triggers" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

### Method 1: Automatic Calendar Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Calendar Trigger">
    1. Go to **Triggers** → **+ Add Trigger**
    2. Select your calendar provider
    3. Set **Notify when:** `2 minutes before`
    4. Set **Check every:** `2 minutes`
    
    **What these settings mean:**
    - **Notify when:** How far in advance to trigger your agent before a meeting starts
    - **Check every:** How often the system polls your calendar for new or updated events
    
    Both should be set to 2 minutes so your agent can catch last-minute meetings. If "Check every" is set to 10 minutes and someone adds a meeting 5 minutes from now, the bot might miss it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Relevance Meeting Bot Trigger">
    1. In **Triggers**, click **+ Add Trigger**
    2. Select **"Relevance Meeting Bot"**
    
    This trigger receives transcripts after meetings end.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Send Meeting Bot Tool">
    1. Go to **Tools** → **+ Add Tool**
    2. Add **"Send Meeting Bot"**
    3. Configure the meeting URL and bot name
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test">
    Create a test meeting with a video link 5-10 minutes from now and verify the bot joins.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Manual Invitation

Send the meeting link directly to your agent:

```
Join this meeting: https://meet.google.com/abc-def-ghi
```

## Platform Notes

| Platform | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **Google Meet** | No special permissions needed |
| **Zoom** | Host may need to admit from waiting room |
| **Microsoft Teams** | Works best with enterprise accounts |

## Summary Format

Configure your agent prompt to generate summaries:

```
After each meeting, create a summary with:
1. Meeting overview (date, attendees, duration)
2. Key discussion points
3. Decisions made
4. Action items: [Owner] Task - Due date
5. Open questions
```

## Distribution

Send summaries to:
- **Slack** - Post to channels or DM attendees
- **Email** - Send to participants
- **Google Docs / Notion** - Store in documentation
- **CRM** - Log notes to Salesforce or HubSpot
