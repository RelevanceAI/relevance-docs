## How it works

  <Step title="Pre-meeting" icon="calendar">
    Agent triggers from your calendar and sends a meeting bot to join.
  </Step>
  <Step title="During meeting" icon="video">
    While you focus on the conversation, the agent works silently:
    - Capturing comprehensive audio and video recordings
    - Creating accurate speaker-identified transcription
    - Detecting key moments, decisions, and actionables
    - Identifying discussion themes and topic clusters
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post-meeting" icon="file-lines">
    Processes the complete transcript by speaker and timestamp, then extracts domain-specific insights tailored to your needs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How to setup a Meeting Notetaker Agent

### Step 1: Create your agent

[Create a new agent](/agent/build-your-agent) or clone Nate, a production-ready notetaker from the [Relevance AI Marketplace](https://relevanceai.com/agent-templates-meetings/). If you want to build your own, you can take inspiration from Nate's configuration.

### Step 2: Add critical tools

Your Meeting Notetaker Agent requires these essential tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Send meeting bot** | Dispatches the meeting bot to join and record a call |
| **Send meeting bot message** | Sends a chat message from the meeting bot to participants |
| **Pause meeting bot recording** | Pauses the recording while staying in the meeting |
| **Resume meeting bot recording** | Resumes recording after it has been paused |
| **Turn transcript into text file** | Converts the transcript into a downloadable text file |
| **Google Search** | Searches the web for keywords during live meetings |

These are pre-built tools available in your agent's tool library.

<Tip>
Start with **Send meeting bot** and **Turn transcript into text file** for basic functionality. Add the other tools as you expand your agent's capabilities.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Choose how to run your agent

#### Option A: Automatic (add triggers)

<div style={{ position:"relative",paddingBottom:"56.25%",height:0 }}>
  <iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmkdjwr5c0gx9qm44i9w77ftm" frameBorder="0" title="Setting up Meeting Notetaker triggers" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

Set up triggers if you want your agent to automatically join meetings from your calendar. Connect two triggers:

- **Calendar** (Google Calendar or Outlook): Monitors your schedule and sends the bot to join meetings
- **Relevance Meeting Bot**: Receives the transcript after the meeting ends

<Note>
You'll need to admit the bot as a guest into the meeting through your video platform.
</Note>

#### Option B: manual

If you prefer to run your agent manually, simply send the meeting link directly to your agent:

```
Join this meeting: https://meet.google.com/abc-def-ghi
```
