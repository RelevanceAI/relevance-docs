A Meeting Notetaker Agent joins your meetings, records conversations, and generates summaries with action items. Unlike fixed tools, it offers customizable functionality that extracts precisely the insights relevant to your domain, whether you need product feedback, technical requirements, or sales objections.

## How It Works

**Pre-Meeting**: Agent triggers from your calendar and sends a meeting bot to join.

**During Meeting**: While you focus on the conversation, the agent captures audio/video, creates speaker-identified transcription, detects key moments and decisions, and identifies discussion themes.

**Post-Meeting**: Processes the complete transcript by speaker and timestamp, then extracts domain-specific insights tailored to your needs.

## Why Choose This Agent?

- **Domain-Specific Insights**: Configure the agent to understand your business context and industry terminology
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works with Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, and more
- **Custom Summary Formats**: Extract technical specs, competitive intelligence, or customer sentiment
- **Enterprise Security**: SOC-2 compliant with comprehensive knowledge capture
- **Workflow Integration**: Transform meeting notes into case studies, roadmaps, pitch decks, social content, or onboarding docs

## Prerequisites

- Calendar integration (Google Calendar or Outlook)
- "Relevance Meeting Bot" trigger added to your agent
- "Send Meeting Bot" tool added to your agent
- Distribution channel (Slack, email, etc.) - optional

## Setup

### Method 1: Automatic Calendar Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Calendar Trigger">
    1. Go to **Triggers** → **+ Add Trigger**
    2. Select your calendar provider
    3. Set **Notify when:** `2 minutes before`
    4. Set **Check every:** `2 minutes`
    
    **What these settings mean:**
    - **Notify when:** How far in advance to trigger your agent before a meeting starts
    - **Check every:** How often the system polls your calendar for new or updated events
    
    Both should be set to 2 minutes so your agent can catch last-minute meetings. If "Check every" is set to 10 minutes and someone adds a meeting 5 minutes from now, the bot might miss it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Relevance Meeting Bot Trigger">
    1. In **Triggers**, click **+ Add Trigger**
    2. Select **"Relevance Meeting Bot"**
    
    This trigger receives transcripts after meetings end.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Send Meeting Bot Tool">
    1. Go to **Tools** → **+ Add Tool**
    2. Add **"Send Meeting Bot"**
    3. Configure the meeting URL and bot name
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test">
    Create a test meeting with a video link 5-10 minutes from now and verify the bot joins.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Manual Invitation

Send the meeting link directly to your agent:

```
Join this meeting: https://meet.google.com/abc-def-ghi
```

## Platform Notes

| Platform | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **Google Meet** | No special permissions needed |
| **Zoom** | Host may need to admit from waiting room |
| **Microsoft Teams** | Works best with enterprise accounts |

## Summary Format

Configure your agent prompt to generate summaries:

```
After each meeting, create a summary with:
1. Meeting overview (date, attendees, duration)
2. Key discussion points
3. Decisions made
4. Action items: [Owner] Task - Due date
5. Open questions
```

## Distribution & Integration

**Send summaries to:**
- **Slack**: Post to channels or DM attendees
- **Email**: Send to participants with transcript and recording links
- **Google Docs / Notion**: Store in documentation, tag attendees
- **CRM**: Log notes to Salesforce or HubSpot

**Turn conversations into assets:**

Connect your Meeting Notetaker to other agents and tools to transform meeting content:
- Convert customer calls into case studies and testimonials
- Transform product feedback into development roadmaps
- Turn sales conversations into pitch deck improvements
- Package expert interviews into social media content
- Compile training sessions into onboarding documentation
