## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pre-Meeting: Automatic Triggering">
    The agent monitors your calendar and automatically joins meetings with video conference links
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="During Meeting: Recording & Transcription">
    A meeting bot joins as a participant, records audio/video, and transcribes in real-time with speaker identification
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Post-Meeting: Processing & Distribution">
    The agent generates summaries, extracts action items, and distributes to Slack, email, or other tools
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up Your Meeting Notetaker Agent

### Prerequisites

Before setting up your Meeting Notetaker Agent, ensure you have:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="RecallAI Integration" icon="robot" href="/integrations/popular-integrations/recallai">
    Required for meeting bot functionality
  </Card>
  <Card title="Google Calendar Integration" icon="calendar" href="/integrations/popular-integrations/google-calendar">
    Required for automatic meeting detection (optional for manual triggering)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Step 1: Connect Integrations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="RecallAI">
    1. Navigate to **Integrations & API Keys** in the left sidebar
    2. Find and click on "RecallAI"
    3. Click "Connect" and follow the authentication flow
    4. Your RecallAI integration is now ready to use
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Google Calendar">
    1. Navigate to **Integrations & API Keys**
    2. Find and click on "Google Calendar"
    3. Click "Connect" and authenticate with Google
    4. Grant **calendar-read-write** permissions
    5. Your calendar is now connected
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Create Your Agent

You can either clone a pre-built template or create from scratch:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Clone Template" icon="copy" href="https://relevanceai.com/agent-templates-meetings/">
    Start with a ready-to-use Meeting Notetaker template from the Marketplace
  </Card>
  <Card title="Build From Scratch" icon="hammer">
    Create a new agent and add the "Send Meeting Bot" tool manually
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Step 3: Configure the Send Meeting Bot Tool

The **Send Meeting Bot** tool (powered by RecallAI) is the core of your Meeting Notetaker Agent.

1. In your agent's **Tools** section, add "Send Meeting Bot"
2. Configure the tool settings:
   - **Meeting URL**: The video conference link (Google Meet, Zoom, Teams)
   - **Bot Name**: How the bot appears in the meeting (e.g., "Notetaker Bot")
   - **Recording Settings**: Audio, video, or both
   - **Transcription**: Enable real-time transcription
   - **Speaker Identification**: Automatically identify who said what

<Note>
The meeting bot will join as a visible participant. Always ensure participants are aware of the recording.
</Note>

## Triggering Your Meeting Notetaker

There are two ways to trigger your Meeting Notetaker Agent:

### Option 1: Automatic Calendar Monitoring (Recommended)

Set up automatic triggering so the agent joins meetings without manual intervention:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Calendar Trigger">
    1. Go to your agent's **Triggers** section
    2. Select "Google Calendar" as the trigger
    3. The agent will check your calendar every **2 minutes** for upcoming meetings
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Meeting Criteria">
    Define which meetings to join:
    - Meetings with video conference links (Google Meet, Zoom, Teams)
    - Specific calendar(s) to monitor
    - Meeting title keywords (optional)
    - Time window (e.g., join 1 minute before start)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test the Setup">
    Create a test meeting in your calendar with a video link and verify the agent joins automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2: Manual Triggering

Send a meeting link directly to your agent:

1. Copy the meeting link (Google Meet, Zoom, or Teams)
2. Send it to your agent via chat or API
3. The agent will immediately join the meeting

<Tip>
Manual triggering is useful for ad-hoc meetings or when you want selective control over which meetings to record.
</Tip>

## NEW: Realtime "On Call" Commands

<Note>
**This is a powerful new feature!** Your Meeting Notetaker can now respond to commands during live meetings.
</Note>

### What Are Realtime Commands?

Realtime "On Call" Commands allow meeting participants to interact with your agent during the meeting by mentioning trigger words in the chat. The agent can:

- Pause and resume recording
- Perform Google searches
- Send messages to meeting participants
- Connect to tools like Notion, Slack, Google Docs
- Execute custom actions

  frameBorder="0"
  allowFullScreen
  className="rounded-xl"
></iframe>

### Setting Up Realtime Commands

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Interaction Webhooks">
    1. Go to your agent's **Advanced Settings**
    2. Navigate to **Interaction Webhooks**
    3. Enable the webhook functionality
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Trigger Words">
    Set up keywords that activate the agent:
    
    ```json
    {
      "trigger_words": ["@notetaker", "hey bot", "assistant"],
      "actions": {
        "pause": "pause recording",
        "resume": "resume recording",
        "search": "search for",
        "note": "make a note"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Actions">
    Configure what happens when trigger words are detected:
    - **Pause/Resume**: Control recording during sensitive discussions
    - **Search**: Perform Google searches and share results
    - **Note**: Add specific notes or highlights
    - **Custom Tools**: Connect to any tool in your agent's toolkit
  </Step>
</Steps>

## During the Meeting

### What the Meeting Bot Does

Once the bot joins your meeting:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Records Audio/Video" icon="record-vinyl">
    Captures high-quality audio and video of the entire meeting
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transcribes in Real-Time" icon="closed-captioning">
    Converts speech to text as the conversation happens

### Supported Platforms

The Meeting Notetaker works with:

- **Google Meet**: Full support for recording and transcription

## Post-Meeting Processing

After the meeting ends, your agent automatically processes the recording:

### 1. Transcript Generation

The agent receives the full transcript with:
- Speaker identification
- Timestamps for each statement
- High accuracy transcription (90%+ for clear audio)

### 2. AI-Powered Summarization

Your agent analyzes the transcript and generates:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Meeting Summary">
    A concise overview of the meeting including:
    - Key topics discussed
    - Main decisions made

</Tabs>

### 3. Custom Processing

You can customize what your agent extracts by modifying the prompt:

```
Analyze this meeting transcript and extract:
1. All action items with owners and deadlines
2. Key decisions made and their rationale
3. Any risks or concerns mentioned
4. Customer feedback or feature requests
5. Competitive intelligence discussed
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always Announce the Bot" icon="bullhorn">
    When the bot joins, have it introduce itself:
    
    "Hi everyone, Notetaker Bot has joined to record and transcribe this meeting. All participants will receive a summary afterward."
    
    This ensures transparency and consent.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Audio Quality" icon="volume">
    Before important meetings:
    - Run a test meeting to verify audio quality
    - Ensure all participants have clear microphones
    - Check that speaker identification works correctly
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Customize Summaries by Meeting Type" icon="sliders">
    Create different agents or prompts for different meeting types:
    - **Sales calls**: Focus on customer pain points and objections

    - **1-on-1s**: Capture feedback and development goals
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set Up Escalations" icon="bell">
    Configure your agent to escalate when:
