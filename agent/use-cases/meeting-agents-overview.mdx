## What are Meeting Agents?

Meeting Agents are AI-powered agents that automate meeting workflows from start to finish. They handle everything from scheduling and preparation to note-taking, transcription, and post-meeting follow-ups—freeing your team to focus on the conversation itself rather than administrative tasks.

Unlike traditional meeting tools that simply record or transcribe, Meeting Agents actively participate in your meeting workflows, making intelligent decisions about what to capture, how to summarize, and where to distribute information.
