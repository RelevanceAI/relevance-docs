Meeting Agents handle scheduling, note-taking, transcription, and follow-ups so you can focus on the conversation.

## What Can Meeting Agents Do?

**Meeting Notetaker**
Automatically join meetings, record conversations, transcribe audio, and generate summaries with action items. Works with Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams.

**Meeting Scheduler**
Coordinate meeting times across participants, handle timezone conflicts, and send calendar invitations. No more back-and-forth emails.
