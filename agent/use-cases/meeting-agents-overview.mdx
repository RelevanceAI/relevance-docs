## What Can Meeting Agents Do?

**Meeting Scheduler**
Coordinate meeting times across participants, handle timezone conflicts, and send calendar invitations. No more back-and-forth emails.

*Example:* When scheduling candidate interviews across multiple team members in different timezones, your agent finds times that work for everyone, sends calendar invites, and handles rescheduling if conflicts arise. What would take hours of email chains happens automatically in minutes.

**Meeting Notetaker**
Automatically join meetings, record conversations, transcribe audio, and generate summaries with action items. Works with Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams.

*Example:* When interviewing a candidate, let your agent handle the note-taking. You can focus on building rapport, reading body language, and asking thoughtful follow-up questions instead of scrambling to write everything down. After the interview, review a complete transcript with key discussion points and next steps.
