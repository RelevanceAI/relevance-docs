## What Can Meeting Agents Do?

**Meeting Auto-Scheduling Agent**

Coordinate meeting times across participants, handle timezone conflicts, and send calendar invitations. No more back-and-forth emails.

<Accordion title="Example Use Case: Interview Scheduling">
  When scheduling candidate interviews across multiple team members in different timezones, your agent finds times that work for everyone, sends calendar invites, and handles rescheduling if conflicts arise. What would take hours of email chains happens automatically in minutes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced Example: Legal Scheduling Coordinator">
  Create a Legal Scheduling Coordinator agent that manages multi-district litigation (MDL) deposition schedules using Microsoft Outlook and LawConnect. Monitor incoming deposition requests, cross-reference attorney availability across jurisdictions, and automatically schedule parallel depositions while avoiding conflicts. When scheduling, allocate 4-hour blocks for each deposition, add 1-hour buffer times between sessions, and ensure no attorney is double-booked across jurisdictions. Set up automatic notifications 48 hours before each deposition with location details and participant list. If any attorney becomes unavailable, immediately identify alternative time slots within the next 5 business days and trigger rescheduling notifications to all affected parties.
</Accordion>

**Meeting Notetaker Agent**

Automatically join meetings, record conversations, transcribe audio, and generate summaries with action items. Works with Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams.

<Accordion title="Example Use Case: Interview Note-Taking">
  When interviewing a candidate, let your agent handle the note-taking. You can focus on building rapport, reading body language, and asking thoughtful follow-up questions instead of scrambling to write everything down. After the interview, review a complete transcript with key discussion points and next steps.
