Meeting Agents handle scheduling, note-taking, transcription, and follow-ups so you can focus on the conversation.

## Types of Meeting Agents

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Meeting Notetaker" icon="microphone" href="/agent/use-cases/meeting-notetaker">
    Join meetings, record, transcribe, and generate summaries with action items
  </Card>
  <Card title="Meeting Scheduler" icon="calendar-days" href="/agent/use-cases/meeting-scheduling">
    Coordinate times across participants and handle conflicts
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

1. **Agent receives meeting link** from calendar trigger or manual input
2. **Bot joins meeting** as a visible participant
3. **Records and transcribes** in real-time (90%+ accuracy)
4. **Identifies speakers** and attributes quotes
5. **Generates summaries** and distributes to your channels

<Note>
**Recording Consent:** All participants are notified when the bot joins.
