### What Affects Your Credit Usage

### AI Model Selection

Different AI models have different "appetites" for credits:

- More powerful models generally use more credits
- Less complex tasks can often use simpler, more credit-efficient models
- You'll always see the exact credit cost for each model in the model selector

### Knowledge Operations

When your agent needs to access or update its knowledge base:

- Knowledge sync operations cost the same as running a tool
- These operations power the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities that make your agents smarter

### Bulk Scheduling Operations

Running your Agent on a set of values from a Knowledge table can become costly really fast. We highly recommend you calculate a rough estimate based on how many rows of data you're running your agent on.

## Best Practices for Credit Management
- Pause tasks if unsure of total usage over a period of time
- Match the AI model to the task complexity
- Use your own API keys when possible for external integrations
- Monitor which agents and tools consume the most credits
- Consider upgrading your plan if you need more credit-efficient operations
