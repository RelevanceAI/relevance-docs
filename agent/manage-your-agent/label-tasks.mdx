# Task Labelling

### What is Task Labelling?

Task labelling lets your AI agents tag and organize their work—think of it like adding sticky notes to conversations or tasks. These labels help everyone stay organized and quickly understand what's happening with each task.

### Why Use Task Labels?

- **Stay organized**: Easily track what stage each task is in
- **Provide context**: Quickly see what type of request you're dealing with
- **Improve workflows**: Move tasks smoothly through different stages
- **Generate insights**: Analyze patterns in your agent's work over time

### Setting Up Task Labels in 6 Simple Steps

1. Go to your agent's edit interface
2. Find the **Connected resources** section
3. Click on `Label tasks`
4. Hit the "+" button to add a new tag
5. Give your tag a clear, descriptive name
6. Write instructions for when and how your agent should use this tag

### Tips for Creating Effective Labels

- **Keep it simple**: Use clear, straightforward names
- **Be specific**: "Needs Customer Info" is better than "Pending"
- **Create a system**: Design labels that work together logically
- **Don't overdo it**: Too many labels can become confusing
- **Think about your workflow**: Create labels that match your process steps

### Real-World Examples

Here's how different teams use task labelling:

**Content Team**

- "First Draft" → "Needs Editing" → "Ready for Review" → "Published"

**Customer Support**

- "Technical Issue" → "Billing Question" → "Feature Request"

**Sales Team**

- "New Lead" → "Qualified" → "Ready for Follow-up" → "Closed"

**Research Projects**

- "Primary Source" → "Needs Verification" → "Key Finding"

### Advanced Labelling Strategies

Once you're comfortable with basic labelling, try these advanced approaches:

### Hierarchical Labels

Create parent-child relationships between labels:

- Parent: "Content" → Children: "Blog," "Social," "Email"

### Time-Based Labels

Add urgency or timeline information:

- "Urgent," "This Week," "Long-term Project"

### Status Labels

Show exactly where things stand:

- "Waiting for Input," "In Review," "Approved"

### Team Labels

Direct tasks to specific people:

- "For Marketing Review," "Needs Developer Input"
