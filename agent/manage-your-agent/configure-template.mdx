## Configure template

The **Configure template** feature in Relevance AI is essentially a way to create customizable settings for your agent, similar to how you set up user inputs in the tool builder. This feature makes agent creation and sharing more efficient and user-friendly.

Firstly, it's a time-saver for repetitive information. If you're building an agent that frequently needs to reference certain data - like your company's name or description - you can create template settings for these details. Instead of copying and pasting this information into various places such as the flow builder or core instructions, you can simply reference the template setting. This approach not only saves time but also ensures consistency across your agent's configuration.

Our template feature shines when you want to share your agent with others. By setting up template configurations, you make it easy for other users to customize the agent to their needs. They can simply adjust the template settings to make the agent relevant to their specific use case, without having to dive deep into the agent's core setup.

These template settings are versatile and can be used throughout the agent's configuration - in core instructions, the Flow Builder, and even in tool settings. This flexibility allows for a high degree of customization while maintaining the core functionality of the agent.
