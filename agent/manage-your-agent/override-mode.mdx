When developing an AI agent, it's important to test specific scenarios and responses. Override Mode lets you:

**Hard-code inputs:** You can manually set specific inputs for your agent, simulating particular situations or user queries.

**Define outputs:** Predetermined outputs can be set at various stages of the agent's task, allowing you to test how the agent handles specific information or decisions.

This level of control is really valuable when you're troubleshooting issues, verifying the agent's logic, or exploring how it handles edge cases.

Beyond testing, Override Mode offers a practical way to conserve resources:

Lock in inputs and outputs: by predetermining certain inputs and outputs, you prevent the agent from regenerating them repeatedly.
Save credits: this approach can significantly reduce the number of API calls or computations required, thereby saving on usage credits.
This is particularly useful in scenarios where parts of the agent's task remain constant across multiple runs, or when you're working with a limited budget.

## How to use Override Mode

Navigate to the three dots in the top right corner of the agent chat interface and toggle on `Override Mode`.

Select whether you want to clone the task into override mode for testing, or go directly to Override Mode.

Click the gear icon to bring up the edit agent interface, and navigate to **Tools**. If a tool has been added to your agent, you can now toggle on and configure `Override input` or `Override output`.

Specify the inputs or outputs you want to override, then run the task with these overrides in place.

Remember, while in Override Mode, your agent will use the specified inputs and outputs instead of generating them dynamically, and this can affect the agent's normal decision-making process.
