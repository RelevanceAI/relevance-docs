## Folders: Organize Your Agents with Ease

### What are Folders?

Folders are simple organizational tools that help you group related agents together. Think of them like folders on your computer - they keep everything neat and easy to find as your collection of AI agents grows.

### Why Use Folders?

- **Find agents quickly** - No more scrolling through a long list
- **Group related agents** - Keep your sales agents, customer service agents, or project-specific agents together
- **Maintain a clean workspace** - A tidy workspace means less confusion and faster work

### Creating Your First Folder

1. Go to your agents table in the Relevance AI dashboard
2. Look for the "Create Folder" option (usually a folder icon with a plus sign)
3. Click it and give your folder a descriptive name like "Sales Agents" or "Customer Support"

### Moving Agents Between Folders

Moving agents is as simple as drag-and-drop:

1. Click and hold on any agent
2. Drag it over a folder
3. Release to drop it in

Your agent is now organized in that folder, but still works exactly the same way!

### Managing Your Folders

**Renaming a folder:**

1. Find the folder you want to rename
2. Click the menu icon (⋮) or right-click on it
3. Select "Rename" and type the new name

**Deleting a folder:**

1. Find the folder you want to delete
2. Click the menu icon (⋮) or right-click on it
3. Select "Delete" and confirm
4. Don't worry - your agents will be safely moved back to the main workspace

### Tips for Effective Organization

- **Use clear naming conventions** - Names like "Sales - Active" and "Sales - Archive" are better than "Folder 1" and "Folder 2"
- **Don't create too many folders** - Start simple with 3-5 main categories
- **Organize by purpose** - Group agents by what they do (sales, support, research) or by project
- **Review periodically** - Take a few minutes each month to reorganize as your needs change

### Common Questions

**Q: Is there a limit to how many folders I can create?**

A: While you can create many folders, we recommend keeping your structure simple for easier navigation.

**Q: Can an agent be in multiple folders at once?**

A: Currently, each agent can only be in one folder at a time. Choose the most logical location for each agent.

**Q: Will moving an agent to a folder change how it works?**

A: Not at all! Folders only change how you organize and find your agents - they don't affect functionality.
