## What are Agents?

Agents are AI team members that can work alone, or as part of a team of other agents and real people. Agents have clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and they can choose how best to get their work done using the domain-specific knowledge you teach them, and the tools you equip them with.

## Get started with agents

There are a few ways you can get started with building your own agents:

  <Card title="Agent Templates" icon="robot" iconType="solid" href="/agent/agent-templates">
    You can use one of our existing agent templates which have been created by domain experts in our own team. Modifying an agent is often easier than creating one from scratch (our help docs aim to reduce that gap).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Start from Scratch" icon="circle-play" iconType="solid" href="/agent/agent-configurationt">
    You can build an agent entirely from scratch. Our agent quickstart guide will get you familiar with all the building blocks that make up building out your agents and multi-agent teams.

## Your AI Agent Workforce

<Steps>
  <Step title="Scales to meet demand">
    You can scale agents and multi-agent teams up and down to meet demand. Many of our customers experience seasonal fluctuations in demand, with some time periods or regions requiring more support than others (E.g. Education, hospitality and finance industries).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Increases engagement">
    You can use agents to automate repetitive time-consuming tasks, so that your human employees can be freed up to do more engaging work. Our sales customers love that they can spend more time on customer meetings and closing deals instead of spending so much time qualifying leads. Their BDR agent frees let them move most of there efforts further down the funnel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Learns from experience">
    If your agent cannot answer a question it has been asked by a customer, it can loop in a sales rep or a manager via your preferred communications tool (email, instant chat etc), and store the answer for future use. We send our "I don't know" escalation into a Slack channel. Anyone in our team can just click on the link in there, come into Relevance and give it an answer. Our agent will then rephrase that and answer our customer. You can also insert it into an FAQ knowledge base if you want.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Can work autonomously or on co-pilot">
    Agents on our platform can complete work end-to-end without you needing to be involved at all. For example, we have an agent that checks for new public tools that have been released on our platform every weekday at 9am, and then produces tool explainer webpages and uploads them to Webflow without needing our input at all. The best use-cases for autopilot agents are those that are low-risk (nothing terrible will happen if something goes wrong).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adaptive and non-deterministic">
    Agents do not have to respond to tasks in the exact same way ever time like traditional software solutions. They have the ability to choose the most appropriate way to respond on a case-by-case basis. E.g. A customer support agent might be asked to help a customer resolve a billing issue on one day, or to troubleshoot a technical bug on another day.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When should you use an agent?">
    AI Agents are especially well-suited for repetitive tasks that your human workforce do not want to do. For example, many Sales teams spend a huge amount of time qualifying leads when they could instead focus on more interesting work further down the funnel, like closing deals.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When should you NOT use an agent?">
    One-off tasks: Building a highly-skilled agent takes a lot of work. If you can’t be sure that the agent you want to build will become a valued part of your team on an ongoing basis, it’s better to direct your energy and resources elsewhere.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who should build agents?">
    Domain experts: We believe that the best person for building out agent team members, are the human team members who are currently doing the work you want to delegate to your agent. Remember that the aim isn’t to replace your human team, but to delegate the repetitive, time-consuming tasks that prevent them from focusing on the work they are most fulfilled by.

    For example, an expert sales rep would be the best person to build an agent to qualify leads for them using the tools that their company use on a daily basis. Once the agent is working to their expert standards, they can then focus on stages later on in the funnel, like closing deals (being much more responsive to customer needs).
