Slide Builder is an inbuilt AI agent in Chat that allows you to generate Slides based on your prompt. You can give the Slides a simple prompt, use inbuilt agents like the OpenAI Deep Researcher to find info on a topic and then generate slides, or use your Agents and Workforces to produce an output that our Slide Builder can then turn into Slides! 

## Key Features
- **AI-Generated**: Tell Slide Builder what you want, and it will create a slide deck based on your prompts or instructions.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Ask Slide Builder to modify or update your slides.
- **Content Customization**: Share your pre-existing text, slides, notes and Slide Builder will use your information in the slides.
- **Agent Integration**: Work with your Relevance AI agents to research or generate content.
- **Branding and Design Customization**: Your slides can look and feel exactly like your brand.

## Getting Started
1. **Navigate to Slides**: In [Relevance Chat](https://chat.relevanceai.com/chat/start), select the Slides feature.
2. **Plan your Content and Slide Design**: Look at [Generate Content and Designing Slides](/chat/chat-agents/slide-builder#generating-content-and-designing-slides) for tips.

4. **Present and Share**: Use the slides directly in Slide Builder and share with others.

### Generating Content and Designing Slides
