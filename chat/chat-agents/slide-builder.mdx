Slide Builder is an inbuilt AI agent in Chat that allows you to generate Slides based on your prompt. Slide Builder first creates a presentation outline showing all planned slides, allowing you to review and refine the structure before building. You can give the Slides a simple prompt, use inbuilt agents like the OpenAI Deep Researcher to find info on a topic and then generate slides, or use your Agents and Workforces to produce an output that our Slide Builder can then turn into Slides! 

## Key Features
- **AI-Generated**: Tell Slide Builder what you want, and it will create a slide deck based on your prompts or instructions.
- **Outline Preview**: Review a complete presentation outline with slide titles and descriptions before any slides are built.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Ask Slide Builder to modify or update your slides.
- **Content Customization**: Share your pre-existing text, slides, notes and Slide Builder will use your information in the slides.
- **Agent Integration**: Work with your Relevance AI agents to research or generate content.
- **Branding and Design Customization**: Your slides can look and feel exactly like your brand.
- **Export & Reuse**: Export your slides as JSON to re-use them in a new chat. PDF export coming soon.

### Generating Content and Designing Slides
1. **Generate Content using Prompts**: Tell Slide Builder what content you want on your slide deck. Alternatively, use the '@' to integrate your Relevance AI agent!
2. **Generate Content with a PDF or other files**: Upload a PDF or file with the information you want and Slide Builder will display it on your slides.
3. **Branding and Design Customization using Brand Kit**: Just upload screenshots of the branding or design you want displayed on the slides and Slide Builder will match your style.
4. **Incremental Building**: Request to see the outline first, then build slides one at a time or all at once. Example: "Create 10 slides about frogs, but only build slide 1" lets you preview before completing the full deck.
