Slide Builder is an inbuilt AI agent in Chat that allows you to generate Slides based on your prompt. Slide Builder first creates a presentation outline showing all planned slides, allowing you to review and refine the structure before building. You can give the Slides a simple prompt, use inbuilt agents like the OpenAI Deep Researcher to find info on a topic and then generate slides, or use your Agents and Workforces to produce an output that our Slide Builder can then turn into Slides! 

## Key Features
- **AI-Generated**: Tell Slide Builder what you want, and it will create a slide deck based on your prompts or instructions.
- **Outline Preview**: Review a complete presentation outline with slide titles and descriptions before any slides are built.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Ask Slide Builder to modify or update your slides.
- **Content Customization**: Share your pre-existing text, slides, notes and Slide Builder will use your information in the slides.
- **Agent Integration**: Work with your Relevance AI agents to research or generate content.
- **Branding and Design Customization**: Your slides can look and feel exactly like your brand.
- **Export & Reuse**: Export your slides in multiple formats including PDF, Images, PPTX, and JSON to re-use them in a new chat or share with others.

## Getting Started

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative",paddingTop:"56.25%"}}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmha5hvas0mzc6kif0twz83bs" frameBorder="0" title="Invite a user to a project in Relevance AI" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

1. **Navigate to Slides**: In [Relevance Chat](https://chat.relevanceai.com/chat/start), select the Slides feature.
2. **Plan your Content and Slide Design**: Look at [Generate Content and Designing Slides](/chat/chat-agents/slide-builder#generating-content-and-designing-slides) for tips.
3. **Review and Refine**: Review the generated slides and prompt Slide Builder to make changes.
4. **Present and Share**: Use the slides directly in Slide Builder, share with others, or export them using the Export button.

### Generating Content and Designing Slides
1. **Generate Content using Prompts**: Tell Slide Builder what content you want on your slide deck. Alternatively, use the '@' to integrate your Relevance AI agent!
2. **Generate Content with a PDF or other files**: Upload a PDF or file with the information you want and Slide Builder will display it on your slides.
3. **Branding and Design Customization using Brand Kit**: Just upload screenshots of the branding or design you want displayed on the slides and Slide Builder will match your style.
4. **Remix Slides**: Want to try a fresh look without starting over? Use the Remix feature to instantly refresh your slide designs while keeping all your content intact. It's perfect for exploring different visual styles and layouts—just ask Slide Builder to "remix" your slides and watch as it generates alternative designs. Great for when you want to experiment with different presentations of the same information!
5. **Incremental Building**: Request to see the outline first, then build slides one at a time or all at once. Example: "Create 10 slides about frogs, but only build slide 1" lets you preview before completing the full deck.

## BrandKits and Templates

Slide Builder includes two powerful features to help you create consistent, professional presentations: **BrandKits** and **Templates**.

### BrandKits

A BrandKit ensures your slides are on-brand every time. It defines the visual identity of your presentations, including colours, typography, logos, and even the tone and voice of your content.

Slide Builder comes with **two default BrandKits** to get you started, but you can also create your own custom BrandKit.

#### What's Included in a BrandKit

- **Moodboard images**: Visual references that set the overall aesthetic
- **Colour palette**: Primary and secondary colours for your brand
- **Font styles**: Typography for headers and body text
- **Logos**: Your brand logos to include in slides
- **Brand tone**: The personality of your brand (e.g., professional, friendly, bold)
- **Brand voice**: How your brand communicates (e.g., formal, conversational)
- **AI design guidelines**: Specific instructions for preferred layouts or slide styles

#### Creating a BrandKit

You can create a BrandKit in two ways:

1. **From brand images**: Upload existing brand assets and let AI extract your colours, tone, and font styles automatically.
2. **From scratch**: Manually define each element of your brand, giving you complete control over every detail.

<Tip>
If you have preferred layouts or a particular way you like your slides structured, outline these in your BrandKit's AI design guidelines. This ensures Slide Builder follows your design preferences consistently.
</Tip>

#### How to Create a BrandKit

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative",paddingTop:"56.25%"}}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmkw0hqjf3lh712hh9tkkmw95" frameBorder="0" title="How to create a BrandKit" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

1. Open Slide Builder and click **New BrandKit**, then select **From scratch** to manually build your BrandKit.
2. Upload moodboard images that represent your brand's visual style using the upload icon.
3. Add brand colours using the plus icon under **Colors**, select your desired colours, and click **Done** to confirm.
4. Select font styles for your slide headers and body content.
5. Add your logo by clicking the logo area or dragging and dropping your company image file.
6. Enter brand tone and voice in the provided text fields to define how your brand communicates.
7. Click the **Slide instructions** tab and enter your slide design guidelines.
8. Click **Done** to complete your BrandKit configuration.
9. Select your BrandKit from the list, enter your presentation topic and content, then click send to generate your slides.

### Templates

A Template captures the structure and formula of slides you've already created, allowing you to replicate successful presentations or use them as inspiration for new ones. This makes them perfect for standardising recurring presentations like weekly reports, pitch decks, or training materials.

#### Creating a Template

Templates are created from existing slides. Once you've built a slide deck you're happy with, you can save it as a Template to reuse later.

#### How to Create a Template

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative",paddingTop:"56.25%"}}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmkw1pk1w3msy12hhlmfgdpe1" frameBorder="0" title="How to create a Template" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

1. Click the **Convert to template** button on a previously created slide deck.
2. Enter a template name in the input field, then click **Convert to template** to save your slides as a reusable template.
3. In a new chat, click **Slide Builder** and select your template from the **Templates** section.
4. Enter your presentation topic along with any content to include, then click **Send** to generate your slides.

### Using BrandKits and Templates Together

For the best results, combine both features:

1. **Set your BrandKit first**: Before creating slides, select or create a BrandKit to define your visual identity.
2. **Apply a Template**: Choose a Template that matches the type of presentation you're creating.
3. **Generate your slides**: Slide Builder will use the Template's structure while applying your BrandKit's styling.

This workflow ensures your presentations are both structurally consistent and visually on-brand.

## Exporting Slides

You can export your slides in multiple formats to share, present, or reuse them in other contexts. Slide Builder supports four export formats:

- **PDF**: Export your entire slide deck as a single PDF file, perfect for sharing or printing.
- **Images**: Download each slide as an individual image file, useful for embedding slides in other documents or presentations.
- **PPTX**: Export your slides as a PowerPoint presentation file, compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint and other presentation software.
- **JSON**: Export the slide data structure to upload into a new chat session, allowing you to recreate slides or use them as a reference for future presentations.

### How to Export Slides

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative",paddingTop:"56.25%"}}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmi3vc0s60rg1b7b4uwv31m8d" frameBorder="0" title="Invite a user to a project in Relevance AI" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

Follow these steps to export your slides:

1. **Open your slides in Relevance Chat**: Navigate to your slide deck in [Relevance Chat](https://chat.relevanceai.com/chat/start).
2. **Click Export**: In the top right of the slides pane, click the **Export** button.
3. **Select the desired format**: Choose from PDF, Images, PPTX, or JSON export options.

### Export Limitations and Notes

- **Animations and Moving Elements**: When presenting slides in chat, they may include animations or moving elements. However, when exported, these dynamic elements will be lost. Exported slides will show the static final state of each slide.
