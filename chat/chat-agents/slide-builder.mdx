Slide Builder is an inbuilt AI agent in Chat that allows you to generate Slides based on your prompt. Slide Builder first creates a presentation outline showing all planned slides, allowing you to review and refine the structure before building. You can give the Slides a simple prompt, use inbuilt agents like the OpenAI Deep Researcher to find info on a topic and then generate slides, or use your Agents and Workforces to produce an output that our Slide Builder can then turn into Slides! 

## Key Features
- **AI-Generated**: Tell Slide Builder what you want, and it will create a slide deck based on your prompts or instructions.
- **Outline Preview**: Review a complete presentation outline with slide titles and descriptions before any slides are built.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Ask Slide Builder to modify or update your slides.
- **Content Customization**: Share your pre-existing text, slides, notes and Slide Builder will use your information in the slides.
- **Agent Integration**: Work with your Relevance AI agents to research or generate content.
- **Branding and Design Customization**: Your slides can look and feel exactly like your brand.
- **Export & Reuse**: Export your slides in multiple formats including PDF, Images, and JSON to re-use them in a new chat or share with others.

## Getting Started

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative",paddingTop:"56.25%"}}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmha5hvas0mzc6kif0twz83bs" frameBorder="0" title="Invite a user to a project in Relevance AI" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

1. **Navigate to Slides**: In [Relevance Chat](https://chat.relevanceai.com/chat/start), select the Slides feature.
2. **Plan your Content and Slide Design**: Look at [Generate Content and Designing Slides](/chat/chat-agents/slide-builder#generating-content-and-designing-slides) for tips.
3. **Review and Refine**: Review the generated slides and prompt Slide Builder to make changes.
4. **Present and Share**: Use the slides directly in Slide Builder, share with others, or export them using the Export button.

### Generating Content and Designing Slides
1. **Generate Content using Prompts**: Tell Slide Builder what content you want on your slide deck. Alternatively, use the '@' to integrate your Relevance AI agent!
2. **Generate Content with a PDF or other files**: Upload a PDF or file with the information you want and Slide Builder will display it on your slides.
3. **Branding and Design Customization using Brand Kit**: Just upload screenshots of the branding or design you want displayed on the slides and Slide Builder will match your style.
4. **Incremental Building**: Request to see the outline first, then build slides one at a time or all at once. Example: "Create 10 slides about frogs, but only build slide 1" lets you preview before completing the full deck.

## Exporting Slides

You can export your slides in multiple formats to share, present, or reuse them in other contexts. Slide Builder supports three export formats:

- **PDF**: Export your entire slide deck as a single PDF file, perfect for sharing or printing.
- **Images**: Download each slide as an individual image file, useful for embedding slides in other documents or presentations.
- **JSON**: Export the slide data structure to upload into a new chat session, allowing you to recreate slides or use them as a reference for future presentations.

### How to Export Slides

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative",paddingTop:"56.25%"}}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmi3vc0s60rg1b7b4uwv31m8d" frameBorder="0" title="Invite a user to a project in Relevance AI" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

Follow these steps to export your slides:

1. **Open your slides in Relevance Chat**: Navigate to your slide deck in [Relevance Chat](https://chat.relevanceai.com/chat/start).
2. **Click Export**: In the top right of the slides pane, click the **Export** button.
3. **Select the desired format**: Choose from PDF, Images, or JSON export options.

### Export Limitations and Notes

- **Animations and Moving Elements**: When presenting slides in chat, they may include animations or moving elements. However, when exported, these dynamic elements will be lost. Exported slides will show the static final state of each slide.
