![Relevance Chat](/images/hero-chat.png)

Relevance Chat is our application for using AI Agents and Workforces on the fly, as copilots. You can @ mention Agents, and use pre-built Agents to help you build websites, generate images, and perform deep research. 

Chat is the new way to give your team access to your Agents. Once you build an Agent, or clone one from the Marketplace, in your project, you and your fellow project members can use it in Chat alongside other Agents. 

## Using different LLMs in Chat

You can select the LLM you want to use in Chat:

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%"}}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmfgfi5x0bz4239ozw2fj4het" frameBorder="0" title="How to set up Google Drive as a source of Knowledge" allow="clipboard-write" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

1. Click the name of the LLM you're currently on (or Auto if you've selected 'Auto' previously) in the top right of Chat
2. Search for and select the model you wish to use 
3. Select 'Auto' to allow Chat to select the best LLM for your request

## Using Agents in Chat

Chat provides flexible ways to work with AI Agents in your conversations. You can:

- **Call individual Agents** - Use a single Agent for specific tasks
- **Use multiple Agents** - Combine different Agents in the same conversation for complex workflows
- **Deploy Workforces** - Leverage teams of Agents working together
- **Access Marketplace Agents** - Use pre-built Agents cloned from the [Marketplace](/get-started/marketplace)
- **Use custom Agents** - Deploy Agents you've created and configured yourself (see our [Quick Start Guide](/agent/quickstart-guide))

Simply @ mention any Agent you have access to in your project, and Chat will seamlessly integrate their capabilities into your conversation.

## Supported file types in Chat

Chat empowers you to work with a wide range of file types, both for input and output. Upload documents, images, and data files to provide context to your conversations, and generate new files based on your Agent's responses or built-in Agent outputs. Whether you're analyzing spreadsheets, processing PDFs, or creating presentations, Chat seamlessly handles file operations across different model providers.

Here's a comprehensive breakdown of supported file types by model provider:
