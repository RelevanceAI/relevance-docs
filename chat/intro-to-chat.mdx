Relevance Chat is our application for using AI Agents and Workforces on the fly, as copilots. You can @ mention Agents, and use pre-built Agents to help you build websites, generate images, and perform deep research. 

Chat is the new way to give your team access to your Agents. Once you build an Agent, or clone one from the Marketplace, in your project, you and your fellow project members can use it in Chat alongside other Agents. 

## Using different LLMs in Chat

You can select the LLM you want to use in Chat:

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%"}}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmfgfi5x0bz4239ozw2fj4het" frameBorder="0" title="How to set up Google Drive as a source of Knowledge" allow="clipboard-write" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

1. Click the name of the LLM you're currently on (or Auto if you've selected 'Auto' previously) in the top right of Chat
2. Search for and select the model you wish to use 
3. Select 'Auto' to allow Chat to select the best LLM for your request

## Using Agents in Chat

You can use chat to call a singular Agent, multiple Agents, or even a Workforce. 

## Chat agents

You can also @ mention Agents built specifically for Chat.
