![Relevance Chat](/images/hero-chat.png)

Relevance Chat is our application for using AI Agents and Workforces on the fly, as copilots. You can @ mention Agents, and use pre-built Agents to help you build websites, generate images, and perform deep research. 

Chat is the new way to give your team access to your Agents. Once you build an Agent, or clone one from the Marketplace, in your project, you and your fellow project members can use it in Chat alongside other Agents. 

## Using different LLMs in Chat

You can select the LLM you want to use in Chat:

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%"}}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmfgfi5x0bz4239ozw2fj4het" frameBorder="0" title="How to set up Google Drive as a source of Knowledge" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

1. Click the name of the LLM you're currently on (or Auto if you've selected 'Auto' previously) in the top right of Chat
2. Search for and select the model you wish to use 
3. Select 'Auto' to allow Chat to select the best LLM for your request

## Using Agents in Chat

Simply @ mention any Agent you have access to in your project, and Chat will seamlessly integrate their capabilities into your conversation.

## Saved Prompts

<Note>
Saved prompts are currently in limited availability and being rolled out to select customers.
</Note>

Saved prompts are reusable prompt templates that help standardize common queries across your team. They allow you to create, manage, and share frequently-used prompts with everyone in your project, ensuring consistency and saving time on repetitive tasks.

### Saving a prompt

Save any prompt from your Chat conversations to make it available to all users in your project through the @ menu.

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cminu37g60bizgxadmuzniah7" frameBorder="0" title="How to save a prompt" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

1. Start a new conversation and enter the prompt you want to save
2. After sending your prompt, click the bookmark icon that appears under it
3. Give the prompt a descriptive name and click 'Save'

<Info>
For Enterprise customers, the ability to create and manage saved prompts can be controlled through role-based access controls (RBAC). Learn more about [RBAC and user permissions](/get-started/enterprise/rbac).
</Info>

### Using saved prompts

All users in the project can access and use saved prompts in their Chat conversations. Saved prompts appear alongside Agents in the @ menu, making it easy to reuse standardized prompt templates.

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cminu7wv50bjwgxad462phl9g" frameBorder="0" title="How to use a saved prompt" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

1. Type @ in the chat input field to open the menu
2. Click 'Prompts' in the pop-up that appears
3. Select the saved prompt you want to use from the list

### Managing saved prompts

To delete a saved prompt:

1. Type @ in the chat and click 'Prompts' in the pop-up
2. Click the 'X' button next to the prompt you want to remove
3. Click 'Delete' on the confirmation pop-up to confirm deletion

<Tip>
Combine saved prompts with @ mentioned Agents for powerful workflows that leverage both reusable templates and specialized AI capabilities.
</Tip>

## Supported file types in Chat

Chat empowers you to work with a wide range of file types, both for input and output. Upload documents, images, and data files to provide context to your conversations, and generate new files based on your Agent's responses or built-in Agent outputs. Whether you're analyzing spreadsheets, processing PDFs, or creating presentations, Chat seamlessly handles file operations across different model providers.

Here's a comprehensive breakdown of supported file types by model provider:
