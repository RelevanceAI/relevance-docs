![Relevance Chat](/images/hero-chat.png)

Relevance Chat is our application for using AI Agents and Workforces on the fly, as copilots. You can @ mention Agents, and use pre-built Agents to help you build websites, generate images, and perform deep research. 

Chat is the new way to give your team access to your Agents. Once you build an Agent, or clone one from the Marketplace, in your project, you and your fellow project members can use it in Chat alongside other Agents. 

## Using different LLMs in Chat

You can select the LLM you want to use in Chat:

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative","padding-top":"56.75%"}}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmfgfi5x0bz4239ozw2fj4het" frameBorder="0" title="How to set up Google Drive as a source of Knowledge" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" webkitAllowFullscreen="true" mozAllowFullscreen="true" allowFullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />
</div>

1. Click the name of the LLM you're currently on (or Auto if you've selected 'Auto' previously) in the top right of Chat
2. Search for and select the model you wish to use 
3. Select 'Auto' to allow Chat to select the best LLM for your request

## Organizing your Agents with Pinned Agents

Keep your most important Agents easily accessible by pinning them to the top of your agents list. Pinned agents help you quickly find and use the Agents you rely on most frequently.

### How to pin an Agent

To pin an Agent in Chat:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the Agent">
    Find the Agent you want to pin in your agents list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pin the Agent">
    Click the pin icon next to the Agent's name to pin it
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access your pinned Agents">
    Your pinned Agents will now appear at the top of your agents list for quick access
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Where pinned Agents appear

Pinned Agents are prioritized in two key locations within Chat:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Main agents list" icon="list">
    Pinned Agents appear at the top of your agents list in the main Chat interface, making them instantly accessible
  </Card>
  <Card title="Browse agents section" icon="magnifying-glass">
    When creating a new chat, pinned Agents appear first in the "Browse agents" section, helping you quickly start conversations with your favorite Agents
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Tip>
Pin your most frequently used Agents to save time and streamline your workflow. You can pin multiple Agents and unpin them at any time by clicking the pin icon again.
</Tip>

## Using Agents in Chat

Chat provides flexible ways to work with AI Agents in your conversations. You can:

- **Call individual Agents** - Use a single Agent for specific tasks
- **Use multiple Agents** - Combine different Agents in the same conversation for complex workflows
- **Deploy Workforces** - Leverage teams of Agents working together
- **Access Marketplace Agents** - Use pre-built Agents cloned from the [Marketplace](/marketplace/intro-to-marketplace)
- **Use custom Agents** - Deploy Agents you've created and configured yourself (see our [Quick Start Guide](/agent/quick-start-guide))

Simply @ mention any Agent you have access to in your project, and Chat will seamlessly integrate their capabilities into your conversation.

## Supported file types in Chat

Whether you're analyzing spreadsheets, processing PDFs, or creating presentations, Chat seamlessly handles file operations across different model providers.

Here's a comprehensive breakdown of supported file types by model provider:
