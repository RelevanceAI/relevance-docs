Relevance AI provides a low-code UI for building LLM chains and automations. The UI is called the Notebook. The Notebook is a web-based application that runs in your browser. It is available at [https://app.relevanceai.com](https://app.relevanceai.com).

## Getting started

The Notebook consists of three tabs:
1. Use
2. Build
3. Logs

### Use

Use provides you with an interface for your AI apps that let's you run and test them. Your inputs defined in the chain will be visible as a form and the output will be presented in our viewer which supports Markdown, HTML and Media.

There are different ways use an LLM app:

1. App
2. Run in bulk
3. Chat
4. Schedule
5. API

### Build

The builder is where you create your LLM chains. You can select from a library of transformations and add them as steps in the chain. You can also define the inputs expected of the chain, for example, a file input and a text input.

Each step in the chain can be ran individually in the Notebook. This is useful for testing and debugging your chain.
