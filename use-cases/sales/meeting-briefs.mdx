## Overview

Reps shouldn't be scrambling for context five minutes before a call. A meeting brief agent pulls together everything relevant about an account — recent conversations, deal history, company updates — into a quick summary a rep can scan in under a minute.

## What the agent does

A meeting brief agent compiles a snapshot of the account ahead of a scheduled call:

- Deal stage, value, and key stakeholders
- Summary of recent emails, calls, and notes in the CRM
- Company news, leadership changes, or funding events
- Open support tickets or product feedback
- Suggested talking points based on the deal context

## How to set it up

1. [Build an agent](/build/introduction) with a [prompt](/agent/build-your-agent/prompt) that defines your preferred brief format
2. Connect your CRM — [HubSpot](/integrations/popular-integrations/hubspot) or [Salesforce](/integrations/popular-integrations/salesforce) — for deal and activity data
3. Add [Gmail](/integrations/popular-integrations/gmail) or [Outlook](/integrations/popular-integrations/outlook) to pull recent email threads
4. Add web search for company news and updates

## Scaling it

- Set up a [Trigger](/agent/build-your-agent/triggers) linked to [Google Calendar](/integrations/popular-integrations/google-calendar) so briefs are generated automatically before meetings
- Build a [Workforce](/workforce/workforce-overview/quick-start-guide) that generates the brief and delivers it to the rep via [Slack](/integrations/popular-integrations/slack) or email
