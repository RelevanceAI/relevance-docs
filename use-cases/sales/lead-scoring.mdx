## Overview

Not every lead deserves the same attention. A lead scoring agent evaluates incoming leads against your ICP and buying signals so reps spend their time on the accounts most likely to close.

## What the agent does

A scoring agent takes lead data and returns a qualification assessment:

- Fit score based on ICP criteria (company size, industry, role, geography)
- Intent signals from website activity, content engagement, or social behavior
- Summary of why a lead scored high or low
- Recommended next action — reach out, nurture, or disqualify

## How to set it up

1. [Build an agent](/build/introduction) and define your scoring criteria in the [prompt](/agent/build-your-agent/prompt)
2. Connect your CRM — [HubSpot](/integrations/popular-integrations/hubspot) or [Salesforce](/integrations/popular-integrations/salesforce) — to pull lead data
3. Upload your ICP definition and qualification framework to [Knowledge](/knowledge/create-knowledge)
4. Add web search tools so the agent can research leads beyond what's in the CRM

## Scaling it

- Set up a [Trigger](/agent/build-your-agent/triggers) to score leads as soon as they enter the pipeline
- Use [Bulk Schedule](/agent/give-your-agent-tasks/bulk-schedule) to re-score existing leads after updating your ICP
- Chain into a [Workforce](/workforce/workforce-overview/quick-start-guide) where scored leads automatically get routed to the right rep or outreach sequence
