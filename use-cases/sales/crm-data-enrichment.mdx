## Overview

Incomplete CRM data slows everything down — reps waste time looking up basics, lead routing breaks, and reporting becomes unreliable. An enrichment agent fills in the gaps automatically so your data stays clean without manual effort.

## What the agent does

An enrichment agent takes existing CRM records and fills in missing or outdated fields:

- Company size, industry, location, and revenue range
- Contact job titles, seniority, and department
- Technology stack and tools used
- Social profiles and recent activity
- Firmographic data from public sources

## How to set it up

1. Start with the [Lead Enricher](https://marketplace.relevanceai.com/listing/88ab63e7-f357-48ad-84c6-463be16d850b) from the Marketplace, or [build your own](/build/introduction)
2. Connect your CRM — [HubSpot](/integrations/popular-integrations/hubspot) or [Salesforce](/integrations/popular-integrations/salesforce)
3. Add web search and [LinkedIn](/integrations/popular-integrations/linkedin) tools for sourcing data
4. Write a [prompt](/agent/build-your-agent/prompt) that defines which fields to enrich and what format to return

## Scaling it

- Set up a [Trigger](/agent/build-your-agent/triggers) to enrich new records as they enter the CRM
- Use [Bulk Schedule](/agent/give-your-agent-tasks/bulk-schedule) to clean up existing records in batches
- Chain enrichment into a [Workforce](/workforce/workforce-overview/quick-start-guide) that enriches → scores → routes leads automatically
