## Overview

Generic outreach gets ignored. Personalized messages get replies — but writing them one by one doesn't scale. An outbound agent uses real prospect context to draft tailored emails and LinkedIn messages so your team can send personalized outreach without the manual effort.

## What the agent does

An outbound agent takes prospect data and produces ready-to-send messages:

- Personalized cold emails referencing the prospect's company, role, and recent activity
- LinkedIn connection requests with relevant context
- Follow-up sequences that adapt based on previous touchpoints
- Messaging that matches your team's tone and value props

## How to set it up

1. Start with [LinkedIn Outreach](https://marketplace.relevanceai.com/listing/5508c7f6-f3a7-4593-8faf-22fbecc4e0d4) from the Marketplace, or [build your own](/build/introduction)
2. Connect [Gmail](/integrations/popular-integrations/gmail) or [Outlook](/integrations/popular-integrations/outlook) for email, and [LinkedIn](/integrations/popular-integrations/linkedin) for social
3. Upload messaging playbooks, email templates, and tone-of-voice guides to [Knowledge](/knowledge/create-knowledge)
4. Write a [prompt](/agent/build-your-agent/prompt) that defines your outreach style, structure, and what personalization to include

## Scaling it

- Use [Bulk Schedule](/agent/give-your-agent-tasks/bulk-schedule) to generate outreach for an entire prospect list
- Build a [Workforce](/workforce/workforce-overview/quick-start-guide) where a research agent feeds context directly into the outbound agent
- Add [Escalations](/agent/build-your-agent/escalations) so reps review messages for high-value accounts before sending
