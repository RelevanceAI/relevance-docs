## Overview

Deals get lost when reps can't speak to how you compare. A competitive intelligence agent monitors what competitors are doing and keeps your team up to date — so they can position effectively without spending hours on manual research.

## What the agent does

A competitive intelligence agent tracks competitor activity and produces actionable summaries:

- New product launches, feature updates, and pricing changes
- Press coverage, funding rounds, and leadership changes
- Job postings that signal strategic direction
- Social media activity and customer sentiment
- Updated battle cards your reps can use in conversations

## How to set it up

1. [Build an agent](/build/introduction) with a [prompt](/agent/build-your-agent/prompt) that defines which competitors to track and what to look for
2. Add web search and [Firecrawl](/tool/tool-steps/firecrawl) tools for monitoring competitor websites and news
3. Upload existing battle cards and positioning docs to [Knowledge](/knowledge/create-knowledge) so the agent can build on what you already have
4. Connect [Slack](/integrations/popular-integrations/slack) or [Gmail](/integrations/popular-integrations/gmail) to deliver updates to the team

## Scaling it

- Set up a recurring [Trigger](/agent/build-your-agent/triggers) to run weekly or daily competitor scans
- Build a [Workforce](/workforce/workforce-overview/quick-start-guide) that monitors competitors → updates battle cards → notifies the team
- Use [Bulk Schedule](/agent/give-your-agent-tasks/bulk-schedule) to run a one-time competitive landscape analysis across multiple competitors
