## Overview

Prospect research is one of the most time-consuming parts of any sales workflow. Reps spend hours digging through LinkedIn, company websites, and news articles just to prepare for a single call. An AI agent can do this in seconds.

## What the agent does

A prospect research agent takes a company name or contact and returns a structured brief your rep can scan before a call. This typically includes:

- Company overview, size, industry, and recent funding
- Key contacts and their roles
- Recent news, press releases, or product launches
- Relevant social media activity
- Potential pain points based on industry and company signals

## How to set it up

1. Start with the [Sales Researcher](https://marketplace.relevanceai.com/listing/4b454347-0656-4fee-9c15-8fb2f2713424) from the Marketplace, or [build your own](/build/introduction)
2. Connect a web search tool and optionally [LinkedIn](/integrations/popular-integrations/linkedin) for social data
3. Add your ICP and persona definitions to [Knowledge](/knowledge/create-knowledge) so the agent knows what to look for
4. Write a [prompt](/agent/build-your-agent/prompt) that tells the agent what format you want the output in — bullet points, structured sections, etc.

## Scaling it

Once your agent produces reliable research briefs:

- Use [Bulk Schedule](/agent/give-your-agent-tasks/bulk-schedule) to research an entire prospect list before a campaign
- Set up a [Trigger](/agent/build-your-agent/triggers) to automatically research new leads as they enter your CRM
- Chain it into a [Workforce](/workforce/workforce-overview/quick-start-guide) where research feeds directly into personalized outreach
