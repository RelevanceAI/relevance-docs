## 1. Pick your first agent

The fastest way to get started is to grab a pre-built agent from the [Marketplace](/marketplace/intro-to-marketplace). For sales teams, we recommend starting with one of these:

<div style={{ display:"grid", gridTemplateColumns:"repeat(3, 1fr)", gap:"16px" }}>
  <div className="agent-card">

    <span className="agent-card-name">Sales Researcher</span>
    <span className="agent-card-desc">Researches companies and contacts before calls so reps show up prepared.</span>
    <a href="https://marketplace.relevanceai.com/listing/4b454347-0656-4fee-9c15-8fb2f2713424" target="_blank" className="agent-card-btn">Use Agent</a>

    <span className="agent-card-name">Lead Enricher</span>
    <span className="agent-card-desc">Fills in missing firmographic and contact details automatically.</span>
    <a href="https://marketplace.relevanceai.com/listing/88ab63e7-f357-48ad-84c6-463be16d850b" target="_blank" className="agent-card-btn">Use Agent</a>
  </div>
  <div className="agent-card">

    <span className="agent-card-name">LinkedIn Outreach</span>

  </div>
</div>

Clone one to your workspace and you'll have a working agent in seconds. You can also [build one from scratch](/build/introduction) if you have a specific workflow in mind.

## 2. Connect your sales tools

Most sales agents get better when they can read and write to the tools your team already uses. Head to [Integrations](/integrations/introduction) and connect the ones that matter for your workflow:

- **CRM** — [HubSpot](/integrations/popular-integrations/hubspot) or [Salesforce](/integrations/popular-integrations/salesforce) to pull account data and log activity
- **Email** — [Gmail](/integrations/popular-integrations/gmail) or [Outlook](/integrations/popular-integrations/outlook) for sending outreach and follow-ups
- **LinkedIn** — [LinkedIn](/integrations/popular-integrations/linkedin) for prospecting and social selling
- **Web research** — built-in search and [Firecrawl](/tool/tool-steps/firecrawl) for scraping company websites and news

<Tip>
You don't need to connect everything at once. Start with your CRM and one outreach channel, then add more as you expand.
</Tip>

## 3. Give your agent context

Upload any material that helps your agent sound like part of the team:

- Your ICP and target persona definitions
- Messaging playbooks and email templates
- Competitor battle cards
- Product one-pagers or pitch decks

Add these as a [Knowledge](/knowledge/create-knowledge) source so your agent can reference them when researching prospects or drafting outreach.

## 4. Test with a real prospect

Give your agent a task to see it in action. Try something like:

> "Research Acme Corp and their VP of Sales. Summarize what they do, any recent news, and draft a personalized connection request."

Review the output, tweak the agent's [prompt](/agent/build-your-agent/prompt) if needed, and iterate until you're happy with the quality.

## 5. Scale it up

Once you're confident in the output:

- Use [Bulk Schedule](/agent/give-your-agent-tasks/bulk-schedule) to run the agent across a list of prospects
- Set up [Triggers](/agent/build-your-agent/triggers) to run automatically when new leads enter your CRM
- Add [Escalations](/agent/build-your-agent/escalations) so the agent flags anything it's unsure about for human review
- Build a [Workforce](/workforce/workforce-overview/quick-start-guide) to chain multiple agents together — for example, research → enrich → write outreach → send

## Building a sales agent

If you want to go beyond marketplace agents and build something tailored to your team's exact workflow, head over to [Build with Relevance AI](/build/introduction).

Before you start building, think through a few things:

### What job is this agent doing?

Keep the scope tight. An agent that does one thing well — like researching prospects or writing follow-up emails — will outperform one that tries to handle the entire pipeline. If you need multiple steps, build separate agents and connect them in a [Workforce](/workforce/workforce-overview/quick-start-guide).

### What does the agent need to know?

Your agent is only as good as the context you give it. Think about what a new sales rep would need on their first day:

- **Who you sell to** — upload your ICP, target personas, and any segmentation criteria
- **How you talk** — add messaging guides, email templates, and tone-of-voice docs
- **What you're selling** — product overviews, feature lists, pricing context
- **Who you're up against** — competitor battle cards and positioning docs

Load these into [Knowledge](/knowledge/create-knowledge) so the agent can pull from them when it works.

### What tools does it need access to?

Map out the actions your agent needs to take. A prospect research agent might need web search and your CRM. An outreach agent needs email or LinkedIn. A lead enrichment agent needs your CRM and data sources. Only connect what's necessary — you can always add more later.

### What should it escalate?

Decide where the human stays in the loop. Common escalation points for sales agents:

- High-value accounts that need a personal touch
- Responses that don't match your brand voice
- Situations the agent isn't confident about
- Anything involving pricing or contract terms

Set these up with [Escalations](/agent/build-your-agent/escalations) so the agent knows when to hand off.

### Start simple, then layer on

Build the simplest version first — a single agent with a clear prompt, one or two tools, and some knowledge. Test it, refine the prompt, and only then start adding complexity like triggers, bulk runs, or multi-agent workflows.

## What's next

You've got everything you need to start putting AI agents to work across your sales pipeline. Whether you grabbed an agent from the Marketplace or built your own, the best results come from iterating — test with real data, tighten the prompt, and expand from there.
