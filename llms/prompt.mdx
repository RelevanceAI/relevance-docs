## What is a prompt
Prompt is a piece of text and your way of communication with LLMs, 
to provide information and request an action. 
We know this communication is done in natural language form but we also know
that not all communications reach the same success level.

Even though LLMs are improving beyond what we imagined less than a year ago, 
there are still shortcomings to their capacities. 
One critical factor for successful use of LLM is a good prompt. On this page,
we summarize tips on how to form a good prompts. Links to sample prompts 
on Relevance are provided for each tip.

## Tips on writing a good prompt
1. If the LLM needs information for doing a task, provide the information at
the top. Use keywords such as "Context" to specify what the information represents
[(see a sample)](/templates/gpt-on-my-files/#tool-steps).

2. Keep the instruction short and precise. Specify what exactly needs to be done
in the bare minimum required number of words [(see a sample)](/templates/gpt-on-my-files/#tool-steps).
