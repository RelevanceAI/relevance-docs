## Creating Visual Workflows

Workforce provides a clear flowchart view of your entire agent ecosystem, eliminating the complexity of nested agent relationships. With the visual workflow builder, you can:

- Design agent teams with intuitive drag-and-drop connections
- Enable specialized agents to work as peers rather than in hierarchies
- Create workflows that are easy to understand, modify, and monitor

## Connection Types

When building your agent workflows, you can choose between different connection types:

### AI connection

This connection type gives your agent autonomy to determine when to pass control to another agent. The agent evaluates the context and decides if another agent's expertise is needed to complete the task.

### Next step

This connection type creates a mandatory transition between agents. When one agent completes its task, control automatically passes to the next agent in the workflow, ensuring a predictable process flow.

## Tool Integration

Workforce allows you to connect tools directly within your workflow:

- Connect tools directly to agents to enhance their capabilities
- Link tools to other tools to create sophisticated processing chains
- Build complex workflows that combine agent intelligence with specialized tool functionality

## Conditional Logic

Make your workflows smarter with conditional logic:

- Create "if this, then that" rules to determine workflow paths
- Set up decision points that route tasks based on specific criteria
- Build adaptive workflows that respond differently depending on inputs or outcomes

## Getting Started with Workforce

To create your first Workforce:

1. Click on “Workforce” on the left side bar
2. Click on “\+ New Workforce” to open the visual canvas
3. Add your agents to the canvas by dragging them from the sidebar
4. Connect your agents by drawing lines between them
5. Configure each connection by selecting the connection type
6. Add tools to your workflow as needed
7. Set up any conditional logic for routing
8. Save your workflow

## Best Practices

For optimal results with Workforce:

- Start with a clear workflow diagram before building in the interface
- Group related agents together visually to improve readability
- Use descriptive names for your connections to document their purpose
- Test your workflow with various inputs to ensure proper routing
- Monitor agent handovers to identify any communication gaps
- Regularly review and optimize your workflow based on performance
