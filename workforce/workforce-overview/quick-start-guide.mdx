## What is a Workforce?

A Workforce is a team of AI agents that work together to complete multi-step tasks. Instead of building one agent that tries to do everything, you connect specialists — each handling a different part of the process — on a visual canvas.

Think of it like a team of employees: a researcher gathers information, a writer drafts the output, and a reviewer checks the quality. Each agent focuses on what it's best at, and the Workforce handles the handoffs between them.

## How Workforces Work

### Connection types

When building your agent workflows, you choose how agents hand off to each other:

- **AI connection** — the agent decides when to pass control to another agent based on context. Great when you want the agent to use judgement about whether another specialist is needed.
- **Next step** — a mandatory transition. When one agent finishes, the next one starts automatically. Use this for predictable, sequential processes.

### Tool integration

You can connect tools directly within your workflow:

- Connect tools to agents to extend what they can do
- Link tools to other tools to create processing chains
- Combine agent intelligence with specialized tool functionality

### Conditional logic

Make your workflows smarter with routing rules:

- Create "if this, then that" rules to determine workflow paths
- Set up decision points that route tasks based on specific criteria
- Build adaptive workflows that respond differently depending on inputs or outcomes

## Where are Workforces most useful?

Workforces are ideal when a task requires multiple steps, skills, or handoffs that a single agent can't handle well on its own:

- **Content pipelines**: A researcher gathers information, a writer drafts the content, and a reviewer checks quality before publishing
- **Lead processing**: One agent qualifies inbound leads, another enriches the data, and a third routes them to the right sales rep
- **Customer support escalation**: A frontline agent handles common questions and hands off complex issues to a specialist agent
- **Report generation**: Agents collect data from multiple sources, analyze it, and compile a final report
- **Onboarding workflows**: Coordinate welcome emails, account setup, training material delivery, and check-ins across multiple agents

## How to get the most from your Workforce?

1. **Start with a clear workflow**: Map out your process before building — know which agents handle which steps and how they hand off.
2. **Keep agents focused**: Each agent should have a single responsibility. A researcher shouldn't also be writing and reviewing.
3. **Choose the right connection type**: Use AI connections when the agent needs judgement about handoffs. Use next step for predictable, sequential flows.
4. **Name connections clearly**: Descriptive names document the purpose of each handoff and make your workflow easier to understand.
5. **Test with varied inputs**: Run different scenarios to make sure routing works as expected and edge cases are handled.
6. **Monitor and optimize**: Review workflow performance regularly to identify bottlenecks or communication gaps between agents.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many agents can I add to a Workforce?">
    There's no hard limit on the number of agents in a Workforce. However, simpler workflows with clearly defined roles tend to perform better than overly complex ones.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between an AI connection and a next step?">
    An AI connection lets the agent decide when to hand off based on context — it uses judgement. A next step is a mandatory transition that always fires when the previous agent finishes. Use AI connections for flexible routing and next steps for predictable sequences.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use tools inside a Workforce?">
    Yes. You can connect tools directly to agents within your Workforce, or link tools to other tools to create processing chains.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I reuse agents across multiple Workforces?">
    Yes. The same agent can participate in multiple Workforces. This is useful when a specialist agent — like a data enrichment agent — is needed in several different workflows.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I debug a Workforce that isn't working as expected?">
    Review the workflow execution to see which agent handled each step, what it received, and what it passed on. This helps you identify where the process broke down — whether it's a routing issue, a tool failure, or a prompt that needs refining.
