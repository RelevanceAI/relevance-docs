This guide walks you through creating a Workforce. For an overview of what Workforces are and how they work, see [Workforces](/workforce/workforce-overview/quick-start-guide).

## Create your first Workforce

1. Click **Workforce** in the left sidebar
2. Click **+ New Workforce** to open the visual canvas
3. Add your Agents to the canvas by dragging them from the sidebar
4. Connect your Agents by drawing lines between them
5. Configure each connection — choose between an **AI connection** (the Agent decides when to hand off) or a **next step** (mandatory transition)
6. Add Tools to your workflow as needed
7. Set up any conditional logic for routing
8. Save your Workforce

<Tip>
Map out your process before building — know which Agents handle which steps and how they hand off. Simpler Workforces with clearly defined roles tend to perform better than overly complex ones.

## What's next?

Once you've created a Workforce, explore the rest of the build guides to refine it:

- [Add triggers](/workforce/build-an-ai-workforce/add-triggers) — configure what starts your Workforce (manual, integration, or scheduled)
- [Introduction to nodes](/workforce/build-an-ai-workforce/introduction-to-nodes) — understand the building blocks of your Workforce canvas
- [Add Agents](/workforce/build-an-ai-workforce/add-agents) — add and configure Agents on the canvas
- [Add Tools](/workforce/build-an-ai-workforce/add-tools) — connect Tools directly within your workflow
- [Add conditions](/workforce/build-an-ai-workforce/add-conditions) — create routing rules for smarter workflows
- [Edge settings](/workforce/build-an-ai-workforce/edge-settings) — configure how connections between nodes behave
