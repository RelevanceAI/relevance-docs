## How Agent to Agent Configuration Works

When you connect one agent to another in your workforce, you're establishing a relationship that determines how these agents will interact. This connection creates a pathway for information to flow from one agent to another, allowing for specialized handling of different aspects of a task.

## Setting Up Agent to Agent Connections

To create an Agent to Agent connection in your workforce:

1. Navigate to the "Build" section of your workforce
2. Ensure you have at least two agents added to your workspace
3. Click and drag from the output node of the first agent to the input node of the second agent
4. A connection line will appear, and the edge settings panel will open

## Connection Type Options

When configuring Agent to Agent connections, you have two primary communication style options:

### AI connection

This option gives the first agent autonomy to determine when it should involve the second agent. The agent uses natural language understanding to follow your instructions about when to delegate.

To configure this option:

1. Select "AI connection" in the edge settings
2. Complete the "When to call this agent" field with clear instructions
3. For example: "Call this agent when you need specialized knowledge about financial regulations" or "Delegate to this agent when the customer asks about technical product specifications"

### Next step

This option creates a mandatory transition from one agent to another. When the first agent completes its work, it will always pass control to the second agent.

To configure this option:

1. Select "Forced handover" in the edge settings
2. Choose between "Always start a new task" or "Always continue with one task"

## Task Continuity Options

For both communication styles, you can specify how the task should be handled:

- **Create new task**: The second agent begins a fresh task with its own context
- **Continue same task**: The second agent continues within the same task, maintaining context and history

## Best Practices for Agent to Agent Configuration

### When to Use "AI connection"

- For complex workflows where conditional routing is needed
- When you want the first agent to make intelligent decisions about escalation
- In scenarios where not every interaction requires the specialized knowledge of the second agent

### When to Use "Next step"

- For linear workflows with clear handoff points
- When you want to ensure every interaction passes through a specific sequence of agents
- For quality control processes where a second agent should always review the work

### Creating Effective Agent Instructions

When using "AI connection", the quality of your instructions in the "When to call this agent" field is crucial:

- Be specific about the conditions that should trigger delegation
- Include examples of scenarios where the second agent should be involved
- Define clear boundaries of responsibility between agents

## Limitations

- Currently, only one-way communication is supported between agents
- Bidirectional communication (where agents can have back-and-forth conversations) is not yet available

## Example Use Cases

### Customer Support Triage

Connect a general support agent to specialized agents for technical, billing, or account issues. The first agent handles basic inquiries and delegates complex issues to specialists.

### Content Creation Pipeline

Connect a content planning agent to a content writing agent, and then to a content editing agent, creating a streamlined production workflow.

### Research and Analysis

Connect a data collection agent to an analysis agent, where the first agent gathers information and the second performs in-depth analysis of the collected data.

## Troubleshooting

If your Agent to Agent configuration isn't working as expected:

- Verify that the connection line is properly established between agents
- Check that your "When to call this agent" instructions are clear and specific
- Ensure that both agents have the necessary tools and permissions to complete their tasks
- Review the task history in the Workforce Task View to identify where the workflow might be breaking down

By effectively configuring Agent to Agent connections, you can create sophisticated AI workflows that leverage the specialized capabilities of different agents, resulting in more powerful and flexible automation solutions.
