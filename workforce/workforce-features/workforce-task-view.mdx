## Accessing the Workforce Task View

To access the Workforce Task View:

1. Navigate to the "Task" section in your selected Workforce
2. The Task View interface will display all current and recent activities for your selected workforce

## Key Features

### Real-Time Task Monitoring

Track the status and progress of all tasks being handled by your workforce in real time. The Task View provides a comprehensive overview of:

- Active tasks currently being processed
- Completed tasks with timestamps and outcomes
- Tasks awaiting approval or human intervention
- Failed tasks that require attention

### Manual Trigger Activation

Initiate workflows directly from the Task View interface:

1. Locate the manual trigger you want to activate
2. Enter your message or prompt to start the workflow
3. Submit the trigger to activate the associated agent or process
4. Monitor the task's progress as it moves through your workforce

This functionality allows you to test workflows, handle one-off requests, or manually start scheduled processes when needed.

### Approval Management

The Task View serves as your central hub for managing approvals within your workforce:

1. Receive notifications when agents require approval to proceed
2. Review the agent's proposed actions or responses
3. Approve, reject, or modify the agent's work
4. Provide additional context or instructions if needed

This approval system ensures quality control while allowing your workforce to operate autonomously when appropriate.

### Conversation History

Access complete conversation histories and task logs for comprehensive tracking:

- View the full thread of interactions between agents and users
- Examine decision points and tool usage throughout a task
- Reference previous tasks for context or troubleshooting
- Export conversation logs for reporting or analysis

### Task Timeline

The Task View provides a chronological timeline of all activities, giving you visibility into:

- When tasks were initiated
- How long each step in the process took
- Which agents or tools were involved at each stage
- When human intervention occurred
- Final resolution and completion times

## Working with the Task View

### Monitoring Multiple Tasks

The Task View allows you to monitor multiple concurrent tasks across your workforce:

1. Tasks are organized chronologically with the most recent at the top
2. Use filters to focus on specific task types, agents, or statuses
3. Expand individual tasks to see detailed information
4. Toggle between different workforces if you have multiple configured

### Handling Escalations

When agents escalate issues requiring human attention:

1. You'll receive a notification in the Task View
2. The escalated task will be highlighted for visibility
3. Review the agent's reason for escalation and the current task state
4. Provide guidance, additional information, or take over the task as needed
5. Once resolved, the agent can continue processing or the task can be marked complete

### Approval Workflows

For tasks configured to require human approval:

1. The agent will complete its work and submit it for review
2. The task will appear in your approval queue within the Task View
3. Review the agent's work, including any generated content or proposed actions
4. Approve the work to allow the agent to proceed or continue to the next step
5. Reject or request modifications if changes are needed
6. Provide feedback to help improve future performance

## Best Practices

### Organizing Your Task View

- Use clear naming conventions for your triggers and agents to easily identify tasks
- Configure appropriate approval thresholds to balance autonomy and oversight
- Set up notification preferences to stay informed of critical tasks
- Archive completed tasks regularly to maintain a clean interface

### Effective Monitoring

- Check the Task View regularly for items requiring attention
- Use filters to focus on high-priority tasks or specific workflows
- Review completed tasks periodically to identify optimization opportunities
- Monitor task completion times to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with tasks in the Task View:

1. Check the task's history to identify where the process stalled
2. Review any error messages or agent notes
3. Verify that all connected tools and resources are functioning properly
4. Test the workflow with a manual trigger to reproduce the issue
5. Adjust agent settings or tool configurations as needed
