## Adding Agents to Your Workforce

You can add Agents you've already created to your Workforce by following these instructions

1. Open your Workforce, and drag or click an Agent onto your Workforce
2. Using the right-hand sidebar, select the Agent you want to add to your Workforce

## Create Agents within your Workforce

You can also create Agents within the Workforce builder by following these instructions:

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative",paddingTop:"56.25%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmb4jv9bp2c84ppkp6qe4p412" frameBorder="0" title="How to create Agents from the Workforce builder in Relevance AI" allow="clipboard-write" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />

</div>

1. Open your Workforce, and drag or click an Agent onto your Workforce
2. Then, when the right-hand sidebar opens, click 'Create new agent'
3. You should then be able to name, describe and change the icon of your Agent
4. Afterwards, you can change your Agent's Prompt, add Tools, and access all sections of your Agent aside from the ones mentioned below from the Workforce builder\!

<Warning>
  You cannot edit your Agent's triggers from the Workforce builder, as Workforce's have their own Triggers. You also cannot access your Agent's Advanced Settings.
</Warning>

## Edit Agents within your Workforce

You can also edit your Agents by clicking on them within the Workforce.

<div style={{ width:"100%",position:"relative",paddingTop:"56.25%" }}>
<iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmb4kb3vz2ca6ppkpuvhwcpo1" frameBorder="0" title="How to edit Agents in the Workforce builder in Relevance AI" allow="clipboard-write" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen style={{ position:"absolute",top:0,left:0,width:"100%",height:"100%",border:"3px solid #5E43CE",borderRadius:"10px" }} />

</div>

1. First, click on the Agent you want to edit
2. Then, the right-hand sidebar should open, allowing you to make any edits you need
3. After you've made an edit, you will need to save your Agent before continuing to make edits to other parts of your Workforce

<Warning>
  When you edit an Agent from the Workforce builder, it changes the settings for that Agent everywhere. We do not have Workforce-specific Agent settings.
</Warning>

## Connect Agents in your Workforce together

Once you've added two or more Agents to your Workforce, you can connect them together by following these instructions:

1. Click and drag from one Agent to create a connection line to another Agent
2. When connecting Agents, you'll be prompted to select a connection type:

- **AI connection**: The Agent makes its own decision on whether to talk to another Agent
- **Next step**: An Agent will always hand over what it was doing to the next Agent, regardless of its finished state

3. After creating a connection, click on the connecting line to configure edge settings
   - For '**AI connection**' connections:
     - Complete the "When to call this agent" box with natural language instructions
     - Set approval mode (auto run, approval required, or let agent decide)
     - Configure max auto runs as a guardrail
     - Choose between 'always start a new task' or 'always continue with one task'
   - For '**Next step**' connections:
     - Choose between 'always start a new task' or 'always continue with one task'
4. Click the 'Save' button to save your configuration

## Connection type

When connecting Agents, you can configure how they communicate with each other:

### AI connection

Use natural language to explain how the Agent should behave. The Agent will follow your instructions but will escalate if it needs help or clarification.

- **Communication Settings**: Explain in natural language when this Agent should be called. For example, if a manager Agent is delegating to another Agent, explain the logic for when to delegate to that specific Agent.
- **Approval mode**:
  - **Auto run**: The Agent will complete the task without approval
  - **Approval required**: The Agent will draft the task but ask for approval before completing
  - **Let Agent decide**: The Agent will complete the task if confident, otherwise will ask for approval
  - **Max auto runs**: Set a limit on the number of times the Agent auto runs

### Next step

This setting forces one Agent to pass the task to another Agent. The handover must happen regardless of the first Agent's state.

## Best Practices for Adding Agents

1. **Define Clear Roles**
   - Give each Agent a specific role and responsibility within your workforce
   - Avoid overlapping responsibilities that could cause confusion
2. **Create Logical Workflows**
   - Arrange Agents in a way that follows a natural progression of tasks
   - Consider the information flow between Agents when designing your workforce
3. **Use Descriptive Connection Instructions**
   - When using "AI connection", provide clear, detailed instructions about when to delegate
   - Include specific criteria or conditions that should trigger the handover
4. **Test Incrementally**
   - Add and test Agents one at a time to ensure each connection works as expected
   - Use the Task View to monitor how Agents interact with each other
5. **Set Appropriate Approval Levels**
   - For critical tasks, use "Approval required" to maintain human oversight
   - For routine tasks, consider "Auto run" to maximize efficiency

## Monitoring Your Multi-Agent Workforce

After adding Agents to your Workforce:

1. Go to the 'Task' view to see your Workforce in action
2. Here you can trigger your Workforce via manual messages/conversation
3. Monitor when specific Agents need approvals
4. Observe how Agents communicate and hand off tasks to each other
