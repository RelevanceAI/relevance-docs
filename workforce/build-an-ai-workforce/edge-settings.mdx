## Connection types

When connecting nodes in your workforce, you can choose between two primary connection types:

### AI connection

This option gives your agent autonomy to determine when to use a connection based on natural language instructions.

**Configuration Options:**

- **Communication Settings**: Provide natural language instructions explaining when and how the agent should use this connection. For example, if you're connecting a manager agent to a specialist agent, you might write: "Delegate to this agent when a customer inquiry requires technical expertise about our enterprise product features."
- **Approval mode**: Control how the agent executes tasks through this connection:
  - **Auto run**: The agent will automatically execute the task without requiring approval.
  - **Approval required**: The agent will draft the task but wait for your approval before completing it.
  - **Let agent decide**: The agent will complete the task if it has sufficient context and confidence; otherwise, it will ask for human approval or clarification.
- **Max auto runs**: Set a limit on the number of times the agent can automatically execute this connection without human intervention:
  - **No limit**: The agent can use this connection as many times as needed.
  - **Custom limit**: Specify a maximum number of automatic executions as a guardrail.

<Warning>
  Each tool execution—including retries—counts toward your **Agent Autonomy Limit**. If you set a max auto-run limit of 3 and the tool retries multiple times, those retries accumulate toward the overall autonomy limit for the agent.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Example:** If Tool A has a max auto-run limit of 3 and runs 3 times (including retries), then Tool B runs 7 times, that equals an autonomy limit of 10 (3 + 7 = 10). Every execution counts, whether it's a first run or a retry.
</Tip>

- **Task behaviour**: Choose how tasks flow through this connection:
  - **Create new task**: Each time this connection is used, it creates a separate task instance.
  - **Continue same task**: Maintain continuity by keeping all work within the same task context.

### Next step

This option creates a mandatory connection where one node always passes control to another node when triggered.

**Configuration Options:**

- **Task behaviour**: Choose how tasks flow through this forced connection:
  - **Create new task**: Each handover creates a separate task instance.
  - **Continue same task**: Maintain continuity by keeping all work within the same task context.

## Practical Applications

### Agent-to-Agent Communication

When connecting agents, edge settings determine how they collaborate:

- **Manager-Specialist Relationship**: Configure a manager agent to delegate specific types of inquiries to specialist agents using "AI connection" with clear instructions about when to delegate.
- **Sequential Processing**: Use "Next step" to create a workflow where one agent always passes work to another after completing its part, such as having a research agent always pass findings to a content creation agent.

### Agent-to-Tool Communication

Edge settings control how agents interact with tools:

- **Conditional Tool Usage**: With "AI connection", an agent can determine when a particular tool is appropriate based on the context.
- **Approval Workflows**: For sensitive operations like sending emails or making purchases, configure "Approval required" to ensure human oversight.
- **Automated Sequences**: Use "Next step" to ensure an agent always follows a specific process, such as always logging customer interactions after completing a support conversation.

### Tool-to-Tool Communication

Create sophisticated automation workflows:

- **Data Processing Pipelines**: Connect tools in sequence to transform, analyze, and act on data without requiring agent intervention at each step.
- **Conditional Branching**: Use conditions between tools to create decision trees that process information differently based on specific criteria.

## Understanding Autonomy Limits and Tool Executions

When configuring max auto runs and approval modes, it's important to understand how tool executions accumulate:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How Tool Retries Affect Autonomy Limits">
    The Agent Autonomy Limit tracks **all consecutive tool executions**, not distinct tool invocations. This means:
    
    - Every tool execution counts, including retries
    - If a tool is configured to retry on failure, each retry counts as a separate execution
    - Multiple tools running in sequence accumulate their executions toward the same autonomy limit
    
    **Impact on Credits:** Each retry also counts as a separate action for credit usage.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Planning for Retries in Your Workflow">
    When setting max auto runs, consider:
    
    - If your tool has retry settings enabled (e.g., max 3 retries), a single tool invocation could consume up to 3 executions
    - Set your autonomy limit high enough to accommodate potential retries across multiple tools
    - Monitor your workflow's actual retry patterns and adjust limits accordingly
    
    **Example:** If you have 3 tools in sequence, each with 2 potential retries, your autonomy limit should be at least 6 to allow all tools to complete with retries if needed.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic connections and gradually increase complexity as you understand how your workforce operates.
2. **Use Clear Instructions**: When using "AI connection", provide specific, unambiguous instructions about when and how to use connections.
3. **Implement Guardrails**: Use approval requirements and auto-run limits for critical operations to maintain control while allowing automation.
4. **Account for Retries**: When setting max auto runs, factor in potential tool retries to avoid hitting autonomy limits prematurely.
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify that your edge settings produce the expected behavior across different scenarios before deploying to production.
6. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly review how your connections are being used and refine edge settings based on actual performance.

## Limitations

- **One-way Communication**: Currently, connections in the Workforce Builder are limited to one-way communication. Bidirectional communication between nodes is not supported.
- **Decision Complexity**: While conditions can create branching workflows, complex decision trees may require careful planning and potentially multiple condition nodes.

## Related Features

The Edge Settings functionality works closely with other Workforce Builder components:

- **Nodes**: The building blocks (triggers, agents, tools, conditions) that are connected using edges.
- **Configurations**: The specific relationship types between nodes that determine workflow possibilities.
- **Workforce Task View**: Where you can monitor your workforce's operations and approve tasks when required.

## FAQs

**Q: Can I change edge settings after creating a connection?**\
A: Yes, you can modify edge settings at any time by selecting the connection in the Workforce Builder interface.

**Q: How do I know if I should use "Decide when to use" or "Next step"?**\
A: Use "Let agent decide" when you want contextual, intelligent routing based on content. Use "Forced handover" when a connection should always occur regardless of context.

**Q: What happens if I set a limit on auto runs and the limit is reached?**\
A: Once the auto run limit is reached, the agent will request human approval before using that connection again.

**Q: Can I create conditional connections based on specific data values?**\
A: Yes, you can use condition nodes to create branches in your workflow based on specific criteria or data values.

**Q: Do tool retries count toward my max auto runs limit?**\
A: Yes, every tool execution—including retries—counts as a separate execution toward both the max auto runs limit and the Agent Autonomy Limit.
