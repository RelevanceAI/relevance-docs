Zendesk is a leading customer service platform that helps businesses manage support tickets, customer communications, and service operations. With Relevance AI's Zendesk integration, you can seamlessly connect your Zendesk account to your AI agents, enabling them to manage tickets, analyze customer interactions, and automate support workflows, making your customer service more efficient and intelligent.

<Note>
The Zendesk integration in Relevance AI was built by Relevance AI, and is therefore supported by our team, not Zendesk. If you have a question or issue with using Zendesk in Relevance AI, please reach out to our support team. If you have a question or issue that is only about Zendesk, you can reach out to Zendesk support.

## Setting Up Triggers

<Warning>
**Enterprise Plan Required for Triggers**

Zendesk triggers are only available on Enterprise plans. If you want to automatically activate your agents when new support tickets are created in Zendesk, you'll need to upgrade to an Enterprise plan.

[Contact our sales team](https://relevanceai.com/contact) or [book a demo](https://relevanceai.com/book-demo) to learn more about Enterprise features.

**Note:** Zendesk tool steps (actions) are available on all plans - only the trigger functionality requires an Enterprise plan.
</Warning>

For Enterprise plan customers, Zendesk triggers allow you to automatically activate agents when specific events occur in your Zendesk account, such as:

- New ticket created
- Ticket status changed
- Ticket priority updated
- New comment added to ticket
- Ticket assigned to agent

To set up a Zendesk trigger (Enterprise plans only):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Agent Settings">
    Open your agent and go to the **Triggers** tab in the agent settings.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Zendesk Trigger">
    Choose **Zendesk** from the list of available trigger integrations.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Trigger Event">
    Select the specific Zendesk event that should activate your agent (e.g., "New Ticket Created").
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Map Variables">
    Map Zendesk ticket data (subject, description, requester, priority, etc.) to your agent's input variables.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test and Activate">
    Test your trigger to ensure it works correctly, then activate it to start automating your support workflows.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tool Steps for Zendesk

The Zendesk integration provides a comprehensive set of actions that your agents can use to interact with your support tickets and customer data. These actions can be incorporated into your agent's workflows as tool steps, enabling sophisticated customer service automation capabilities.

</Tip>

## Use the Integration's API Tool Step (Advanced)

In addition to the pre-built actions available in the tool directory, you can build custom tools that perform Zendesk-specific activities using the **Zendesk API Call** tool step.

<Info>
**Required Headers**

When using the Zendesk API Call tool step, authentication headers are automatically included. You only need to specify:
- **Method**: The HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- **Endpoint**: The API endpoint path (e.g., `/api/v2/tickets.json`)
- **Body**: Request body for POST, PUT, or PATCH requests (optional)
</Info>

### How to use the Zendesk API Call tool step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new tool">
    Create a new tool in Relevance AI or open an existing tool you want to add Zendesk functionality to.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add the Zendesk API Call tool step">
    - Scroll down to Tool-steps
    - Search for "Zendesk API Call" in the tool step search bar
    - Add the Zendesk API Call tool step to your workflow
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select your Zendesk account">
    Select your connected Zendesk account from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure the API endpoint">
    Configure the API endpoint, method, and parameters according to your needs:
    - **Method**: Select the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
    - **Endpoint**: Enter the API endpoint path (e.g., `/api/v2/tickets/12345.json`)
    - **Body**: Add any required request body data in JSON format
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure response handling">
    Map the API response to variables in your workflow for further processing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test your API call">
    Test your configuration to ensure it works correctly before deploying.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Adding Tags to a Ticket

Here's a practical example of using the Zendesk API Call tool step to add tags to an existing ticket:

**API Endpoint:** `PUT /api/v2/tickets/{ticket_id}.json`

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "method": "PUT",
  "endpoint": "/api/v2/tickets/12345.json",
  "body": {
    "ticket": {
      "tags": ["urgent", "vip", "billing"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Uses the PUT method to update a ticket
- Specifies the ticket ID in the endpoint path
- Adds multiple tags to categorize the ticket
- Tags can be used for filtering, reporting, and automation

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I access tickets from multiple Zendesk accounts?" icon="building">
    Yes, you can connect multiple Zendesk accounts by adding separate integrations for each account. Each integration will appear with its account name in your integrations list, and you can select the appropriate account when configuring tool steps.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I troubleshoot authentication errors?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    If you encounter authentication errors:
    1. Verify your Zendesk subdomain is correct (e.g., `yourcompany.zendesk.com`)
