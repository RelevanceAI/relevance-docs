## Recommended Setup Order

Follow these steps in order for the smoothest Enterprise onboarding experience. Each step builds on the previous one to create a secure, well-governed AI platform for your organization.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Single Sign-On (SSO)" icon="key">
    **Why this matters**: SSO is the foundation of Enterprise security. It ensures all users authenticate through your identity provider, enabling centralized access control and compliance.
    
    **What you'll do**:
    - Configure SSO with your identity provider (Okta, Azure AD/Entra ID, or Google Workspace)
    - Test SSO login flow
    - Enforce SSO for all organization members
    
    **Time required**: 30-45 minutes
    
    [Set up SSO →](/docs/get-started/enterprise/sso-setup)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Directory Sync & Groups" icon="users">
    **Why this matters**: Directory Sync automatically provisions users and syncs groups from your identity provider, eliminating manual user management and enabling bulk access control.
    
    **What you'll do**:
    - Connect your identity provider directory to Relevance AI
    - Configure which groups to sync
    - Verify group synchronization
    
    **Time required**: 20-30 minutes
    
    <Info>
    **Feature Status**: Directory Sync & RBAC Groups are in Beta with full rollout by **November 20, 2025**. Contact your sales representative to enable this feature.
    </Info>
    
    [Configure Directory Sync →](/docs/get-started/enterprise/rbac-groups#setting-up-directory-sync)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Plan Your Organization & Project Structure" icon="sitemap">
    **Why this matters**: A well-planned organizational structure makes it easier to manage permissions, track usage, and scale your AI workforce as your team grows.
    
    **What you'll do**:
    - Decide how to organize projects (by team, department, or use case)
    - Plan folder structure for agents and assets
    - Determine project ownership and admin assignments
    
    **Time required**: 15-30 minutes (planning)
    
    [Review best practices →](/docs/get-started/enterprise/org-structure-best-practices)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)" icon="shield-halved">
    **Why this matters**: RBAC ensures users only have access to what they need, supporting security, compliance, and operational control.
    
    **What you'll do**:
    - Assign organization-level roles (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer)
    - Set project-level permissions (Admin, Editor, Member, Chat, Viewer)
    - Configure asset-level access for sensitive agents and tools
    - Assign groups to projects and assets (if using Directory Sync)
    
    **Time required**: 30-60 minutes
    
    [Configure RBAC →](/docs/get-started/enterprise/rbac)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Usage Limits & Monitoring" icon="gauge-high">
    **Why this matters**: Usage controls help you manage costs, prevent overuse, and ensure fair resource allocation across teams.
    
    **What you'll do**:
    - Set organization-wide credit limits
    - Configure project-level usage caps
    - Set up usage alerts and notifications
    - Review usage dashboards
    
    **Time required**: 15-20 minutes
    
    [Configure usage limits →](/docs/get-started/project-management/usage-limits)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect S3 Bucket for Event Streaming (Optional)" icon="database">
    **Why this matters**: Streaming events to your own S3 bucket provides audit logs, compliance data, and usage analytics for your security and data teams.
    
    **What you'll do**:
    - Create and configure an S3 bucket
    - Set up IAM permissions
    - Connect your bucket to Relevance AI
    - Verify event streaming
    
    **Time required**: 20-30 minutes
    
    <Info>
    **Feature Status**: S3 Event Streaming will be fully available by **November 20, 2025**, with self-serve setup by end of year. Contact your sales representative for early access.
    </Info>
    
    [Set up event streaming →](/docs/get-started/enterprise/streaming-events)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Integration Controls" icon="plug">
    **Why this matters**: Integration controls let you govern which third-party services your teams can connect, supporting security policies and compliance requirements.
    
    **What you'll do**:
    - Review available integration controls
    - Set organization-level integration policies
    - Configure project-level integration restrictions
    - Set up organization and project-level API keys
    
    **Time required**: 15-20 minutes

## Best Practices for Enterprise Deployment

### Start with Security First

Configure SSO and RBAC before inviting your entire organization. This ensures users have appropriate access from day one.

### Use Groups for Scale

If you have more than 20 users, use Directory Sync and Groups instead of managing individual user permissions. This saves time and reduces errors.

### Plan Before You Build

Take time to plan your organization structure before creating projects and assets. Restructuring later is more difficult than getting it right from the start.

### Follow the Principle of Least Privilege

Grant users the minimum permissions they need to do their work. You can always expand access later, but restricting access after the fact is harder.

### Assign Clear Ownership

Every project should have a clear owner (Admin) who is responsible for managing access, monitoring usage, and maintaining assets.

### Monitor Usage Regularly

Set up usage alerts and review dashboards weekly, especially during the first month. This helps you understand consumption patterns and adjust limits as needed.

### Document Your Policies

Create internal documentation for your team about:
- How to request access to projects
- Naming conventions for projects and assets
- Approval processes for new integrations
- Escalation paths for access issues

### Test with a Pilot Team

Before rolling out to your entire organization, test your setup with a small pilot team (5-10 users). This helps you identify issues and refine your configuration.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**How long does Enterprise setup take?**

Most organizations complete the core setup (Steps 1-5) in 2-3 hours. The optional steps (S3 streaming, integration controls) add another 30-60 minutes.

**Can I skip steps in the recommended order?**

While you can technically skip steps, we strongly recommend following the order. SSO and Directory Sync should always come first, as they affect how users access the platform.

**What if I don't have an identity provider?**

Enterprise features require an identity provider (Okta, Azure AD/Entra ID, or Google Workspace). If you don't have one, you'll need to set one up before using SSO and Directory Sync features.

**Can I change my organization structure later?**

Yes, but it's easier to plan ahead. You can rename projects, move assets, and restructure teams, but this requires updating permissions and may temporarily disrupt access.

**How do I get help during setup?**

Enterprise customers have access to dedicated support. Contact your sales representative or [reach out to our support team](/docs/get-started/support) via your Slack channel or other support methods.

**What happens if I don't complete all setup steps?**

You can use Relevance AI without completing all steps, but you won't have full Enterprise security and governance capabilities. We recommend completing at least Steps 1-4 (SSO, Directory Sync, Organization Structure, and RBAC) for a secure deployment.
