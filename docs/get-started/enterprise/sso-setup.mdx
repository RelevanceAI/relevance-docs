<Note>
SSO is available for Enterprise customers only. If you're not on an Enterprise subscription, [contact our sales team](https://relevanceai.com/contact) to learn more.
</Note>

Single Sign-On (SSO) enables your organization to authenticate users through your identity provider (IDP), providing centralized access control, enhanced security, and a seamless login experience. With SSO, users can access Relevance AI using their existing corporate credentials.

SSO is the foundation of Enterprise security in Relevance AI. Once configured, you can enforce SSO for all organization members, ensuring all authentication flows through your identity provider.

## Supported Identity Providers

Relevance AI supports SSO through the following identity providers:

- **Okta** — Industry-leading identity and access management
- **Azure AD / Microsoft Entra ID** — Microsoft's cloud-based identity service
- **Google Workspace** — Google's enterprise identity platform

All SSO integrations use industry-standard SAML 2.0 or OIDC protocols for secure authentication.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up SSO, ensure you have:

- **Enterprise subscription** with Relevance AI
- **Organization Owner or Admin** access in Relevance AI
- **Admin access** to your identity provider (Okta, Azure AD/Entra ID, or Google Workspace)
- **Domain verification** — Your organization must own and verify the email domain(s) you'll use for SSO

<Warning>
Setting up SSO requires coordination between your Relevance AI admin and your identity provider admin. Plan to have both available during setup.
</Warning>

---

## Troubleshooting

### Users Can't Log In via SSO

**Symptoms**: Users see an error when trying to log in via SSO

**Common causes**:
- User is not assigned to the application in your identity provider
- User's email domain doesn't match your configured domains
- SSO configuration has incorrect URLs or metadata

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the user is assigned to the Relevance AI application in your IDP
2. Check that the user's email domain is allowed in your SSO configuration
3. Review your SSO configuration and ensure all URLs and metadata are correct
4. Test with a different user to isolate the issue

### SSO Login Redirects to Wrong URL

**Symptoms**: After SSO authentication, users are redirected to an incorrect URL

**Common causes**:
- Incorrect ACS URL or Reply URL in identity provider configuration
- Browser caching old redirect URLs

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the ACS URL / Reply URL in your IDP matches the URL provided by Relevance AI
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Try in an incognito/private browser window

### Attribute Mapping Issues

**Symptoms**: User profile information (name, email) is missing or incorrect after SSO login

**Common causes**:
- Incorrect attribute mappings in identity provider
- User profile in IDP is missing required fields

**Solutions**:
1. Review attribute mappings in your identity provider configuration
2. Ensure the following attributes are mapped correctly:
   - `email` → user's email address
   - `firstName` → user's first name
   - `lastName` → user's last name
3. Verify the user's profile in your IDP has these fields populated

### Metadata URL Not Working

**Symptoms**: Error when entering metadata URL during SSO setup

**Common causes**:
- Metadata URL is not publicly accessible
- Metadata URL has expired or changed
- Network/firewall blocking access to metadata URL

**Solutions**:
1. Test the metadata URL in a browser to ensure it's accessible
2. If using Azure AD, ensure you copied the **App Federation Metadata Url**, not the certificate
3. If the URL is not accessible, download the metadata XML file and upload it directly instead

### SSO Works But Directory Sync Doesn't

**Symptoms**: Users can log in via SSO, but groups aren't syncing

**Common causes**:
- Directory Sync is not enabled or configured
- SCIM provisioning is not set up in identity provider
- Directory Sync feature is not enabled for your organization

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Directory Sync is enabled for your organization (contact your sales representative if needed)
2. Follow the [Directory Sync setup guide](/docs/get-started/enterprise/rbac-groups#setting-up-directory-sync)
3. Ensure SCIM provisioning is configured in your identity provider

## Security Best Practices

### Always Enforce SSO

Once SSO is configured and tested, enforce it for all organization members. This ensures all authentication flows through your identity provider and prevents users from bypassing SSO with email/password login.

### Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Configure MFA in your identity provider for an additional layer of security. Relevance AI will honor your IDP's MFA requirements.

### Regularly Review User Access

Periodically review which users and groups have access to Relevance AI in your identity provider. Remove access for users who no longer need it.

### Monitor SSO Logs

Review SSO authentication logs in your identity provider to detect suspicious login attempts or unauthorized access.

### Rotate Certificates Regularly

If your identity provider uses certificates for SAML authentication, ensure they're rotated before expiration. Update Relevance AI with new metadata when certificates change.

### Use Directory Sync

Enable Directory Sync to automatically provision and deprovision users based on your identity provider. This ensures access is always in sync with your organizational structure.

### Test Before Enforcing

Always test SSO with multiple users before enforcing it organization-wide. This helps identify configuration issues before they affect all users.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Can I use multiple identity providers?**

No, each Relevance AI organization can only connect to one identity provider at a time. If you need to support multiple IDPs, contact your sales representative to discuss options.

**What happens to existing users when I enable SSO?**

Existing users can continue to log in with their current method (email/password) until you enforce SSO. Once SSO is enforced, they must use SSO to log in. Their accounts will be matched by email address.

**Can I disable SSO after enabling it?**

Yes, Organization Owners can disable SSO at any time. However, this is not recommended for security reasons. If you need to disable SSO, contact support for guidance.

**Do I need to manually invite users after setting up SSO?**

If you enable JIT (Just-in-Time) provisioning, users will be automatically added when they first log in via SSO. Otherwise, you'll need to invite users manually or use Directory Sync for automatic provisioning.

**What happens if my identity provider goes down?**

If your identity provider is unavailable, users will not be able to log in via SSO. Organization Owners can temporarily disable SSO enforcement to allow email/password login as a fallback. Contact your IDP support for assistance with outages.

**Can I restrict SSO to specific email domains?**

Yes, you can configure allowed email domains in your SSO settings. Only users with email addresses from allowed domains will be able to log in via SSO.

**How do I change my identity provider?**

To switch identity providers, you'll need to disable your current SSO configuration and set up a new one. Contact support for assistance with this process to ensure a smooth transition.

**Is SSO required for Enterprise customers?**

While not technically required, SSO is strongly recommended for Enterprise customers. It provides centralized access control, enhanced security, and is a prerequisite for other Enterprise features like Directory Sync.
